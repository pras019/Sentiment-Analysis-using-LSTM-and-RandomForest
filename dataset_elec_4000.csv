This case is just beautiful. I can't think of anything I don't like about it. I used a smaller-sized GTX 750 which allows you to see everything inside. A bigger video card blocks your view (probably by design).,1.0
My husband purchased these because he likes movies and I am a reader.  I hear no residual sound and the headphones seem to be quite comfortable.  I highly recommend them!,1.0
"Very disappointed.  This item worked a time or two, but never consistently. I replaced the battery and it still wouldn't work.  I followed company instructions to make it work.  Don't waste your money.",0.0
"...first of all, this Lightning cable does exactly what it's supposed to do: it moves data (and electricity) to the Apple device it's connected to (in my case, an iPod Nano (7th generation).

With this cable, you get a little more.

First, you get more length. At 6 feet, it will give you flexibility for where to place your Lighting device at a twice the distance of a standard Lightning cable.

Second, the USB terminal on this cable includes a permanently mounted velco cable management strap, answering the needs of neat freaks.

While you can buy cheaper Lightning cables, the extra length and cable management capability offer a good value at this price.

Select with confidence.

"Very bad, slow, flakey software. Very slow. I was replacing a Buffalo NAS I've had for many years and this has been a complete step down. I have almost zero trust in this thing at all.",0.0
"When it worked it was fine (used for my media center PC in living room) but died under a year. Range was good, kept it 15 to 20 ft from PC. There is no on/off switch on keyboard, so you never know if it is turned on or off (the mouse has a switch).

No lights or indicators to tell you if it is connected, low battery, or anything. So when mine stopped working I had  no way of knowing if was turned off, not connected or the batteries are dead.  Pretty much just kept trying stuff to figure out why it's wasn't working- trial and error.  Ultimately I realized none of those things were the problem, and instead it was just a piece of junk.

Just not worth the aggravation. Lack of an on/off switch on the keyboard alone rules this one out.",0.0

"The remote basically gives you access to everything you need on your G-Box.  However, its longevity leaves much to be desired.  They feel cheap.  The buttons are clunky and just don't feel responsive when you press them.  I have 2 G-Box Midnight boxes.  One of the remotes is very unresponsive.  The arrow keys and the power button are only responsive 75% of the time.  The other completely died in less than a year from very light use.  I purchased secondary remotes to do most of the actions once the box is turned on.  It is poorly manufactured.  I have a G-Box Q.  While it doesn't have all of the buttons that this one does, but it is ""WAY"" more responsive, feels better, and controls just enough of what I need it to when I don't want to fish for my secondary remote.  I purchased this remote exclusively for turning my boxes on and off.  Hopefully, it lasts longer than a year.",0.0
"Display looks muted/faded - contrast not crisp at all. Speakers are overwhelmingly weak and tinny. Browsing is sluggish, even when doing simple tasks such as email. I'm a big YouTube watcher and will often have 4 or 5 tabs open with different videos loaded; this chromebook can't even handle two tabs with videos. It freezes indefinitely, forcing me to close it... it won't restart if I try to press the power button. Even when I'm just surfing news articles, the tab navigation is frustratingly sluggish - every time I go away from a tab and come back to that tab, the page looks blank (white) and takes 2-8 seconds to reload, as if it's refreshing the content. Absolutely unacceptably annoying.  On top of all that, the video playback quality is poor and I have no idea why.  I hate this product and want to return it but the company (America's Distributor) won't take it.  Wish I never bought this.",0.0
"This monitor is a great buy, good color, great size - great for movies! The only negative is that the height isn't adjustable but that is nothing that a stack of books can't solve.",1.0
"We had an excellent customer service experience with Kevin the other day.
The time he spent with us on the phone saved us from returning the SkyBell and allowed us to purchase a new part needed to successfully install our new SkyBell. It is functioning perfectly now, and we are very glad and relieved. We are satisfied with the product, after initially jumping through some hurdles to get it installed. Thanks Kevin!",1.0
"This is not an actual replacement for the charger that comes with the Fitbit Flex. It does not have the reset button, which is critical for resetting your Fitbit. This will only charge your device. If you've lost the original charger, you cannot use this to reset your device. While advertised only as a charger, I feel like it was misleading and irresponsible for the product description to omit this fact. You would think that their quality assurance process would include checking to make sure their product met OEM specifications. Very disappointed.",0.0
Very easy to use right out of the box. Plugged it in and transferred my whole hard drive to it!,1.0
"One word sums it up ""WOW!""  I bought a the HDDVD version of ""Phantom of the Opera"" plus i owned a regular DVD version.  When i compared them on the new HDDVD player i could not get over the change in picture.  It was like watching this video on 35mm film.  The quality is excellent.  I have it connected to my In Focus Video Projector on a 100"" screen.  I was totally blown away.  The unit i have for my sound system is a 7.1 Denon which to me is perfect.  The new sound quality on the HDDVD is also amazing.  Running a regular DVD on this new HDDVD unit is also better quality.  It's a win win situation.  I'm sure in time the price, like everything else, will come down.

You will not be disappointed in this unit.  If you have an HDTV you best get the HDDVD player.  You'll be missing a lot if you don't.  I would give this unit 100 stars if i could.  Once your connected, it's easy to run.  The new features are also great and there is just so much to choose from.  Happy Watching!!!!!",1.0
"I really just wanted a rolling laptop bag (which doesn't seem to exist?), whereas this is a small suitcase that has sleeves for a couple laptops in the top.  I generally have the bag empty and two laptops in the sleeves, which means the ""door"" is really heavy and there's nothing underneath holding up the weight, which puts a lot of stress on the zipper.  Also, I'm using it every day to schlep these darned (heavy) laptops around, so it's getting a lot of use.  I'm not sure how long the zipper will last, so I might switch to putting the laptops in the body of the suitcase.  All in all, though, it looks good, holds laptops easily, rolls well, handle extends and collapses readily, etc.  For the price, it's better than I expected.",1.0

At first we were a little disappointed because it was not working with the tablet until we had to go and get an adapter to connect it. Once we got the correct adapter it was great. So easy to use and so handy with our 7in tablet makes things much easier to type on the tablet. The stylus that comes with it is a downfall because it did not work at all with the tablet. Other than that everything else is great.,1.0

"To clarify from the start, this is not a review of the entire camera itself, but rather an alert to potential buyers of the Lumix ZS25.  I just purchased the camera and discovered that it does NOT have stereo microphones as Amazon's detailed description page clearly states!

This may not be a problem for some, but the ZS19, ZS20 and ZS30 have stereo mics and I definitely wanted this feature in the ZS25!  Panasonic, what's wrong with you??  Why would you offer this otherwise attractive camera with full HD video and not stereo audio??  I'm baffled by that one.

So do not take this as a review of the remaining features of the camera itself, but just beware that it records mono audio and the product description is a lie!",0.0

"The first thing is you need to realize that is a 17 inch Laptop, so you cannot compare it to a 13 inch one.

Excellent for using it in a house or at work.
I carry mine around my house (in my bed, in the kitchen, in the terrace) and its very easy to transport.
The performance is great. I erase the Windows Vista it came with and upgraded to Windows 7 and is working as a charm.  Windows XP works great as well.
The screen is a delight!! as crisp as an LCD TV. And the blue ray works great.
no noise and not too much glare.
I love it when I'm using graphics software, specially my Photo editing ones (A.Photoshop)

"I have a client concerned about a reliable backup for his office server. Over the past few years he had worn out two WD My Books.

"Amazingly this works as advertised.  Setup was simple and quick...no hassle.  In less than an hour I had everything installed and working.  The actual monitoring does not start until 3 days after you activate.  This is to allow you time for testing the system without notifying the police.  Once that three days is up you'll get an email telling you that your system is now fully monitored and the police will be notified in the event of an alarm breach.

The only complaint I have it that the extra horn we ordered would not work at first.  I opened it up and they had only installed 3 batteries (takes 4).  I added an extra battery and it still did not work.  The three that were in it were dead...after replacing those everything worked fine.  Despite this slight inconvenience I still felt this was worthy of a 5-star rating due to the ease of setup and the basic fact that it works as advertised.",1.0

"Okay so by the time I got a chance to order the deal of the day the Harman Kardon headphones were sold out. So, they replaced them for this.  Whoever made the decision to replace these headphones for the Kardon's had to be sitting back laughing and thinking, ""I am going to straight piss some people of today!!!""
Simply put the quality of this headphones is extremely cheap.

I do agree with others about the issues with noise from handling, the small switches (I often have to put my glasses on to see the switches!), and the sudden battery popping out bit.

"I really liked the headphones, they are light and comfortable, and I don't even feel them while walking. The sound is pretty good too, setup was easy, and initially was happy.

The problem came when I tried to use them while walking, the sound kept cutting in and out. If I had my iPhone7 in my hand or breast pocket, there was no sound issues, but as soon as it went in my back pocket, it started cutting out again.
I contacted skullcandy for support who gave me some troubleshooting to do. I tried the steps and no improvement.
They provided more steps which involved leaving the headphones powered off for 24hrs. This is where I started to get annoyed as they refused to advise why I needed to leave them for 24hrs. I asked 3 times for the reasons behind this. I have done technical support in one for or another for 18yrs and know that this is just a fob off.

I ended up returning the headphones to he point of purchase for a refund.",0.0
"I've tried many wireless bluetooth headsets and this is by far the best.  I'm a truck driver and when I talk to someone they can't hear any of the background noise from the truck and I can hear them perfectly.  It's also so comfortable that I often forget I'm wearing it.
Update on 3/8/2016.  I really hate this bluetooth.  I thought it was just like my Voyager Legend but it isn't.  It doesn't talk to you to tell you it's on or needs charging or to say you're getting a call, nothing.  The Legend tells you if it needs to be recharged.  This one will just turn off without notification.  It sucks and I don't even use it.  I bought two more of the Legends recently and will ONLY use them.  On the Legend you can push a button and it tells you how much talk time you have left before needing to be charged and it also announces who is calling.  This one just doesn't talk at all.",0.0
"BEWARE!!
This charger is specified at 15V output (see the features listed in the item's description on this page above), while the Philips QG3330, for example, is rated at 4.3V (stamped on the shaver body). Philips has a variety of shavers/trimmers, some of them indeed require 15V to charge, but some don't! In short, you need to match the charger to the device.

This is totally irresponsible of Amazon, after people complaining that the charger overheats and destroys the trimmer's battery, to still list erroneous compatibility list that kills attached devices.",0.0

"First, I never rate anything 5 stars because there is always room for improvement. I purchased this to replace my nexus10, since WiFi is not currently working with recent updates. This serves its purpose. 95% of what I do for work and leisure is on the internet. It boots in seconds and is very snappy. If opening a large file, don't expect it to run like your jacked up desktop( but that's why it's less money). This also serves as my laptop. Any word processing can be handled through Google docs, and isn't a problem if you are familiar with Google products. If you aren't it may take a little learning as with anything new. Overall great buy for the money and serves the purpose needed. I don't know if there is a need to buy a more expensive chromebook.",1.0

"I found that Sharp VLz7u is good enough for me.  I normally use it for record the activity around my house.  I chose this model because of its swivel grip.  It gives me convenient in many recording angle (e.g. over the head and low angle view).
The thing I like about this camcorder are:
  -  1.3MP photo shot
  -  built in flash (for camera mode)
  -  terminal for Zoom mic (though I cannot find Sharp's Zoom mic available anywhere at this time)
  -  and other features that should be available in other camcorder (e.g. 10x zoom, digital effect, stabilizer, etc)
The things I want to have in the camcorder (though it's not a big deal to me) are:
  -  Microphone input
  -  night shot mode
Since this is my first camcorder, I don't know if other camcorder have better picture quality or not.  But it looks good to me both on TV and after captured onto computer.
For home movie, outdoor/indoor activity, events, you will love this camcorder.  For those who look for high quality picture, or professional movie, you probably should go for other model.",1.0

The noise-cancelling ability of this headset is excellent, as is the voice quality through its earpiece.

"This mouse was GREAT when it worked.  Sure, it was a bit small for lost hands, but that's a convenient size trade-off for portability.  True, it does go through batteries pretty quickly - but then, what Bluetooth device doesn't?  Initially I was quite happy with my V470 because of its quick/smooth/precise response and because it syncs quickly and holds sync well with my MacBook Pro.

So why's not to like?  Just this: after about 5 months of use, the laser stopped tracking on my desktop and in fact on most surfaces.  Now the mouse only tracks on high-gloss surfaces like polished metal or magazine covers.  When I contacted Logitech about my problem, the customer support agent suggested that I try a different USB port (despite my providing the model number, which is only for a Bluetooth mouse) and that I try using a different computer (despite giving plenty of detail describing that there are no communication issues between the mouse and my computer).

In short, Logitech customer support leaves about as much to be desired as Logitech reliability.  This product works great right out of the box, but stand by to replace it in less than six months.",0.0

"This kit is super useful.  Even if you only do simple / basic lens repairs or optics work, this kit is worth the price.

And of course, buying just one is basically one-third the cost of the kit, so might as well buy-em-all (hums pokmon theme: I wanna beeeee the very best-uh)

Works well for spinning lens elements, and also a handy place on which to stand a partially disassembled lens while working on it.

There is a decent amount of flash (overflow) on the parting lines of the finished parts.  It looks sloppy, but doesn't effect how they work.  Probably appropriate for the price of the kit.

"NOT AS DESCRIBED. IT IS A NI-MH BATTERY. IT IS UP TO YOU TO DECIDE IF THIS IS BETTER THAN A LEAD-ACID ONE FOR YOUR USE. THIS IS NOT A LI-ION BATTERY. I WAS REALLY DISAPPOINTED WHEN I LOOKED CLOSER AND FOUND THAT IT WAS NOT A LI-ION. NI-MH ARE NOT REAL GOOD IN COLD WEATHER.

Lighter in weight than my lead acid ones. It charges fast.....BUT.....not to be recharged when half discharged unless you have an ""intelligent"" charger that tapers the charge as it nears full. The original Panasonic charger just socks the charge to it. This didn't hurt the lead acid, original batteries. IT GETS THIS ONE HOT....REALLY HOT, IF IT IS OVERCHARGED.

Anyway...this fits my AG-456UP video camera perfectly. The one complaint with the company is that they add $4.99 for each battery shipping. Several will fit in a Priority Mail Flat Rate box....and the shipping for up to 6 of these should only be about $11.",1.0

"We burn and use VCDs (Video Compact Discs) at work and we purchased one of these machines to play music CDs, in-house VCDs, and both in-house and commercial DVDs. The documentation claims that the player supports all of these and CD/RW. Not true. The machine will indeed play all of the above, it just doesn't do it very well. Commercial DVDs seem to work just fine as do music CDs, but this player is lousy at playing VCDs. The picture is very poor, much poorer than on any other desktop player that I have tried, and the audio is completely out-of-sync on VCDs. I couldn't believe that a Sony machine could be such a disaster, so we sent the machine back for a replacement. I had to assume that the first machine was faulty. Not so. The second player is just as bad as the first. This is a very poorly designed player, at least for video compact disks. We have not tried the player with our own DVDs and now that I think about it, we have not tried it with in-house music CDs. I would recommend caution with this player.",0.0

I was thinking that this would be too bright and obnoxious but I got it anyways for the price. However, it's a soft shade of purple that I love. The case fits my laptop perfectly. HOWEVER, the bottom piece seems like it can slide off easily. I did manage to clip the bottom clips (with effort) and it seems to be staying for now but I just wish it wasn't a slide on case on the bottom and had more clips to protect it. However, for the price, I say give it a shot!

"First of all, this is a budget laptop -- this is not a monster that cost nearly a grand, so you have to keep your expectations in check.  This laptop works quite well for daily tasks.  The screen is low-resolution, but that is par for the course for this price point.  The processor is quite adequate, and the graphics performance is nice for light gaming.  640 GB hard drive is nice and roomy.  Really, I found only two negatives:

1) The CPU is capable of handling dual-channel RAM, but it only comes with one RAM module.  Add a 2nd module to get a nice memory bandwidth boost -- this should make the CPU and the graphics just a little bit faster.  Note that mine came with a low-voltage 4G module, so I had to hunt for another low-voltage one to put in there (I added a Samsung).

2) The optical drive does not handle marginal-quality discs as well as other drives do.  How often do you use an optical drive, though?

My computer is an Alienware and I never really took notice to the curved and deep lid until this Lifecam wouldn't stay on.

"I bought this item with great hope that it would be THE accessory for a power iPad user.  It started off that way, but then it quickly lost ground.

The cracks are migrating, but they started in the hinge points and the headphone jack opening.  Every time I open the case, it cracks a little more. It is important to know that I baby my equipment.

Really a shame that they used such a brittle plastic.  The keyboard itself is responsive and easy to type on.  It rivals my full size MBP keyboard.  Alas, a great keyboard is only as good as the case in which it sits.

At some point, I might just hack off the plastic upper part of the case that holds the iPad and use the keyboard alone (with an iPad stand of course).  That is how good the keyboard is.

"My original need was for an a/v receiver that had HDMI hookups. With the SONY STR-DG820, which has four (4) HDMI inputs and one (1) HDMI output, I found the perfect blend of quality features and affordability.

In addition, since most of my devices are SONY, I am able to turn on the t.v., A/V receiver, and Blu-ray player with a single button on the remote.

The form factor was great and the fit in my ears was pretty good. The bass however was not as good as I have heard in other earbuds and most importantly, the noise canceling was almost non-existent. It is true that I am comparing them to one of the best noise canceling headphones available and I didn't expect the Phiaton earbuds to be as good as the Bose, but I was hoping they would perform well enough that I could take them on my trip in lieu of the Bose headphones.

"I just purchased this radar detector and I am not happy with it.  First off I found it isn't picking up anything but false alarms. I'm starting to wonder if the police in my area are using something different than this is picking up all together. Driving to work this morning one cop was sitting dead ahead in front of me and it didn't make a sound. Two days ago while driving down the road with it on H for all radar detector signals it beeped once with not one car in front of me and the cop was maybe ten feet in front of me. There is no way to turn off or dim flashing blue lights and it is illegal in this area to have any blue lights on the inside or outside of your car. I found this radar detector would work on false door alarms, however.

"I love Corsair products, but this one isn't one of their best creations. If anything, it's the worst.

This headset just broke on me just now so I thought I'd make a review to warn other people about this product to NOT get it. I only tried putting it on and it snapped. You're better off paying extra for headsets that go over the top of your head instead the back of your neck.

I bought this from my local Fry's store and after a few hours of using, I noticed that headset pinches the top of your ears. I would generally have to move it in a different position because it would get uncomfortable when gaming and I don't even have a big head. Even my $7 mic (which broke after 4 years of use) from Wal-Mart lasted longer than this!

I would not recommend this product.

Pros:
-Good sound quality
-Good mic

Cons:
-Breaks too easily
-Pinches your ears, will get uncomfortable
-General design could have been better",0.0

In comparison my Asus router does 175 on wifi, plugged into this modem of coarse.

"I wanted to wait until I played a few different courses before I reviewed this watch but from the first hole on the first course I tried it has performed spectacularly.

I know my club distances fairly well and as far as I can tell the watch distances have been spot on.  I love knowing exactly how far out from a pin I am especially within a hundred yards where there are no course markers.  Maybe there is a new design but I have had no problem at all charging watch and it seems to hold a charge well.  I don't know what more you could ask for in terms of functions, maybe an exact pin placement distance but with the three distances it offers I can't believe you would be very far off.  After first couple holes of use everyone in my golfing group was asking for a measurement.  Definitely a shot saver.",1.0

"I ordered these headphones after searching for affordable alternatives to more expensive models. These headphones are a great price, but I had two problems with them that have prompted me to return them.

(1) I find these headphones very painful to wear, even for a short period of time. I told myself that all over the ear headphones were bound to be a bit uncomfortable and that I just needed to get used to them, but I then tried on a friend's pair and was stunned by how comfortable they were in comparison.

(2) Although the product description promises hours of battery life, I find that these headphones begin indicating they have a low battery after just one workday. They do come with a cord so that you can plug them into your device and conserve battery, but it's a bit convenient to need to recharge these after every day's use.

These two issues -- especially the comfort factor -- are causing me to return these and purchase a different pair of headphones. However, the sound quality and noise cancelling was decent on these headphones, though not perfect.",0.0

"I bought this in January 2015. Here today in February, ten days after I can no longer return it per Amazon's return policy, this keyboard got a strange electrical burning smell and stopped working. It will not light up, it will not work, and it stinks badly when it is plugged in.

When it was working it worked fine.

It is loud, so if you are on the phone or making a video, or webinar or something like that--it will be heard and commented upon by other people.

Also, the cables are huge and come out in the center of the keyboard, so in my case I was unable to put it close to my laptop, so it took up a lot of desk space.

And the cables are bundled together. That's okay if your sound ports are next to two USB ports. On my laptop the sound ports were next to only one USB port so I needed to have extra cables to reach everything.

I'm disappointed that this keyboard melted (burned itself inside). And now I have no recourse. Instead I've got an expensive paperweight now.",0.0

"(I have been using this SSD for nearly half a year at the time of this review. )

I purchased this SSD to use as a primary boot drive for Windows 10 in a PC I was building for myself. I have built several other systems so I have some experience doing this. Installing Windows to this drive when new yielded no problems, though that should be expected in a new SSD. Boot times are great between Windows 10's quick boot times paired with the speed of this drive. I completed some benchmarks after the SSD had some time on it and the results were as follows:

I had cable before so I unhooked that line from the box and attached it to the antenna, so I didn't have to run a line into the house. It was already there!
I attached a plastic pipe I already had to the antenna and then velcroed it to a pole on my 2nd story deck.

Otherwise, only the edges of the mug touch the heating surface and theres not enough heat transfer.

Disclosure: I received this item free in exchange for an honest review.

I've played around with this speaker in a few settings to ensure I had enough experience with it to conduct an honest review.
The device seems well made, pairs easily with my Android phones and a friends iPhone. The direct connect via headset jack works as well. My only complaint is the sound. It is lacking in any bass at all. There is no problem with the volume levels as the speaker is capable of making a lot of noise but the sound of several different genres of music (rock, techno, classical, metal) were lacking in the bass department. I did want to  like this little speaker, everything about it worked well, The instructions were easy to understand and follow, packaging was good, included cables were good quality... its just the sound is not very good.",0.0

"Worked great to replace my old battery. No instructions included so check out iFixit.com for some hints on how to open the unit. You will have to pry the old battery out with something stronger than the included plastic tool as it is stuck inside the 770 case with double sided tape. New tape is not included with this kit either so you may want to get some or possibly use some RTV sealant to stick the new one on.

I'm using 14 gauge rca speaker wire and there is still quite a gap, i'm not convinced that it will clap even 12 gauge insulated wire. I'm going to use shrink wrap on the insulated wire so it keeps the wire secure in the plug, as of now the only thing holding the wire into the plug is the small set screw.",1.0

Speaking of the outside it it gets dirty it cleans up easily with Windex. the strap is a neat touch also, especially if you use the HDX while walking around while holding it.

Super neat!

"This is a well made general-purpose, full-body, suspension exercise system with lots of documentation on how to use it. Documentation is available from the company as well as online.  One particular reason I like this system is because it's so light-weight, small, and portable.  Also it's quick to move from one exercise to another exercise unlike many other exercise systems--especially compared to weights.  Another good thing is when you target a particular muscle (muscle group), other muscles are engaged, and a full body workout is possible in a short time.  Targeting one muscle with free weights also uses multiple muscles, but I think you may engage even more muscles (muscle groups) with the TRX .  Stretches are also possible.

This exercise system is great for anyone who wants to stay in shape for everyday life.  Since the heaviest weight for any exercise for the TRX is your own body weight, a body builder or professional athlete will need more resistance than your body weight provides, so a body builder/pro will need free weights or weight machines.  But for travel or supplementary exercise, the TRX may still be useful for the advanced user.",1.0

I was pleasantly surprised to see that these rewinders are still available. It's a fine unit that not only looks rforms as one would expect. The only feature that is missing is the fast forward that my old unit(that finally broke down after many faithful uses) offered. Yet one should consider the wear and tear that the vcr head goes through during a forward and rewind mode. This unit could in time pay for itself.,1.0
The highest speed I was able to achieve from one computer to another in an adjacent room was approximately 60Mb/s from with 10-15% packet loss.  With a downstairs to upstairs configuration I could only get an abyssmal 30Mb/s.  I ultimately drilled a hole in the wall and ran an ethernet cable for the adjacent rooms because even at 60Mb/s the packet loss prevented me from doing any kind of streaming.  I ended up keeping the downstairs/upstairs configuration because wireless speeds in my house are even worse and running a cable is not an option for me.  There are no appliances near any of the outlets I plugged in to and I did not use any surge protectors.  My home was only built 8 years ago and I know the wiring is up to today's standards.  For reference I use a gigabit switch and my testing was performed using FTP.,0.0

"This was an impulse buy. Besides, whats $20? I have a pair of Bose Soundsport Bluetooth earbuds I paid $150, so Ill use those as a reference. First and foremost, these Bluetooth earbuds are THE LOUDEST I have ever heard. I cannot turn it up all the way without hearing damage. I have them paired up to my iPhone 8. The sound is great; clean, detailed highs and midrange, bass is very good. Not quite Bose level of detail, but very acceptable. They are very comfortable.

"Picked this up as a rebate was available for its purchase price with a OMD body.  The unit is under powered for anything more then a few feet away, really disappointed with its output, and that it runs on 2- AAA batteries, and for not very long.  I have used 3 sets of batteries, and maybe shot 20 pics with them!  Seems every time I get it out to use, the batteries are dead.  The issue is it has a flaky button to turn it on, you can't really tell it is starting up, and only know its on when the pilot lite comes on or blinks for low battery. It is compact, it's not really made for the OMD body, so I guess they need to get them out of the distributors hands for lack of sales.  As a micro 4/3rds standard accessory, it does work on the Lumix cameras as well.

"It works pretty well and for what I paid, so I can't complain much.

Battery power isn't great.. expect about 45 minutes if watching a movie.  No problems when keeping it plugged in.

My only criticism is responsiveness.  Pretty much any icon I click on, I have to wait about 3-5 seconds for response.  Since this was purchased as an extra tablet for my 2 toddlers (who like to fight over the ipad to watch netflix at bed time), I've had a time trying to convince them to be patient and wait more (the iPad is obviously instant).  This, in itself, isn't too terrible.. but if the buttons get pushed too many times while ""waiting"", the unit has to be rebooted to work.  It just gets stuck.

That said.. if you're patient, it performs as it should.  Apps take a while to load too... and then respond well.",1.0
"First, let me clear up some misperceptions that I see being posted here:

Smart phones, tablets, laptops, and even battery chargers for digital cameras do not require a voltage converter. All you need is an adapter to plug into a foreign outlet (and it's becoming pretty common for hotels and airports to have universal outlets).

There are few electronic devices that you are likely to travel with that require a voltage converter  and some like a hair drier should not be used with the BESTEK converter.

What I use the converter for is my electric toothbrush which will not work with 220-240. There are universal charging bases, but I was having a hard time ordering one so I just went with this.

I've used the BESTEK on multi-week trips all over the world to keep my toothbrush charged. Never had any problems.",1.0

I have owned a trackball mouse since my pre-law college days and would not have a regular mouse ever again.  I work in a fast pace environment and would wear out a mouse in a matter of months since I changed to the trackballs I have only had to replace them when I lost the usb or the ball.

I am also left handed but was able to teach myself to use this with left hand in a few hours.  So it can be used with both right and left hands.

I spent 1 hour trying to turn it off, but can't. To turn it off you need to reset to an earlier version of the setup software and do everything from scratch. The early version does not exist anymore. Not worth my time. This remote is much much worse than the $15 Sony universal remote. Even when it was working, it does not let you configure in any rational way. Horrible, horrible experience.

The actual micro SD card works fine and as expected, but the USB adapter starts out working in my computers and when I try to access the files it loses the connection.

a. they isolate ambient sound better

b. they feel more comfortable

c. they don't add decibles to the sound you hear

Note that according to audiologists, inside the ear phones add about 7 decibles to the sound you are generating (because the phones are directly inside your ear canal). Thus, if you are listening at 90 dbl, it becomes 97. Potentially tinnitis producing !!

They have a audio out port also. But according to technical support, the audio out port is useless because it cannot have a microphone plugged in the audio in port and a speakER in the audio out port at the same time. So I asked the audio port is useless then and they responded with yes. If you need just video, these are great. If you need to add audio, look for a different brand",0.0

"I replaced the first one of these within 30 days, as it just quit playing DVDs completely, and one of the wireless headphones never worked.  The replacement unit worked okay for about a week, and now it is locking up, overheating, getting stuck, yet randomly working fine.  It is very finicky about power.  It seems to not like car power, only the wall outlet.  Performance is more reliable (though not good) when plugged into an outlet.  The screen scratches easily and should have come with one of those plastic screen protectors.  The remote is abysmally designed, crammed with buttons and confusing.  The wireless headphones are a good idea, and work okay most of the time (if they work at all).  Unfortunately, they are prone to bursts of loud popping static from interfering signals.  Within a day I gave my kids some cheap wired headphones to replace the wireless ones.

I had to bend the lip outward to allow the drives to slip fully into the shelf and click into place.

It's like they didn't take measurements of how deep a 3.5"" drive would need.

"I switched from a Blackberry 8830 to an iPhone 3G, and wanted to keep my soft ear-bud headset that I was using with my BBerry (actually a Plantronics headset).  It had a 2.5mm 4 band plug, and the iPhone used a 3.5mm 4 band plug.

I read the reviews, both positive and negative, and figured that I could risk the $0.99.  I guess you get what you pay for!

I only get sound out of the right side.  The microphone works fine.  If I slowly plug the 2.5mm headset into the female side of the adapter, I can get both ear-pieces working, but the mic then cuts out.  I have to leave the plug out about 1/16"" to get stereo, so it looks like the connectors in the adapter socket don't quite line up.

I've tried this with my iPhone and my iPod Nano, and my Plantronics headset and the original Blackberry headset.  Results are the same.  When everything is plugged in tight, only the right channel works.  If I back off the headset plug, both left and right work, but no microphone.

I attached seventeen of these and was having connectivity issues with a few cables. I then decided to randomly test some of the couplers with a cable tester and quickly found the issue about needing the cables pushed in as far as possible. Pull back a little and some of the connections were lost (#1, #4, etc.). I tested some other couplers and they did not have the same issue when using the same test cables.

The build is okay, but it could be sturdier. Don't count too much on support. It takes a long time to answer questions and create tickets for repairs. I had to get newegg involved so they can listen.

I read the reviews commenting on driver problems, but thought these things usually get fixed by the mfr. quickly by updating drivers, etc. Unfortunately Huion is having problems doing this. None of the software I use is compatible with this tablet. The pressure sensitivity of the tablet is not recognized  by any of these programs, and without that, the tablet is pretty much just a mouse. I spent an entire afternoon updating & replacing drivers, looking on the web for solutions and fixes, but instead found a lot of people are having the same problems with all their Huion tablets. None of the solutions I found worked. There is no tech support available. Contact info is a phone number in China.

It's a shame...the tablet itself looks and feels great, and if I could have gotten it to work I would have been writing a different review right now.",0.0

In any case, I tried it at full, half, and a quarter power. Lines where visible across all setting.  It fires great at 250th and below and the trigger worked flawlessly but had to return because of shadow line issue. Will take a look at the AD200.",0.0

"I was in the market for something future proof and was an early adopter of this modem. I purchased it in January and struggled with random latency issues in both gaming and regular web browsing for months. I could not figure out what the problem was. More recently, people have been discovering that there is an issue with the Intel Puma6 SoC that the SB6190 uses. There has been a firmware release to alleviate the latency but it introduces DNS lookup issues. I have nothing against Arris, but they need to work with Intel to fix this problem. I purchased a Netgear CM600 and have not looked back since. I am way outside of my return window so I don't know what to do with this expensive paperweight. I would love to exchange my SB6190 for an SB6183. The SB6183 uses a Broadcom chipset similar to the CM600 and should not have problems like the SB6190.

"I really liked this transmitter at first. It charged while transmitting, and featured a compact design. Then, just the other day, I noticed that the the sound was fluctuating between the left and right side of my car stereo. If you touched the flat connector plug while it was plugged into the iPod, it would play on either the right or left speaker, but never both at the same time. The switching happens even if you--no kidding--move the iPod up in the air an inch. Having used the transmitter for a couple of months, I can see that it is really light and cheaply made, and the whole thing--especially the jack!--is much more flimsy than the old Monster transmitter I have. Grantwood Technology seems to be committed to customer care, but they need to make sure that their products are durable and reliable first. Until then, don't waste your money!

I don't have any proof that the shiny plastic would cause any reflections or flare, but there must be a reason every other hood I've ever seen has a flat interior.  Should have looked more closely because it's not worth sending back.  It's going in the trash when the Canon hood arrives, but it doesn't feel like it would last very long anyhow.

"Bought a new business laptop which was not offered with an optical drive, so I decided to look for a decent external for the few times I use it.

It's obviously not as fast as an internal SATA unit, but it gets the job done with no issue.  I have a 32GB SD card that I use to sync the laptop with my tower, so the optical drive is rarely used, but this works perfectly when I need it.

"Overall: 4/5

I received these for a discount but would absolutely buy them at their current price ($30) again if i lost my current pair. These are a great option for a basic pair of bluetooth earbuds for nearly any use. I use them when i bicycle and to listen to calmijg sounds when i go to sleep.

I previously had a pair of QY7s and these QY11s offer the same quality of manufacturing as well as a number of improvements, including better range and a more sturdy feel. The sound quality is aboit the same, which is very respectable. Audiophiles would be disappointed, but for general use, i think these are perfect.

"Perhaps this product at best is hit or miss. Should have known the 36 db amplification claim was too good to be true. Too many cheaply made items are like this; they have a high failure rate, and are likely untested at the factory. First let me state that I have a strong background in home theater and work as a computer/computer network tech. When I hooked the 'amp' up it not only did not amplify, but attenuated the signals (VHF) it was supposed to amplify the most! Specifically, it blocked channels that came in clear before. For strong analog signals (on cable), the amp should have caused bleeding in some of the colors when turned all the way up--36db should provide significant amplification. It had absolutely no effect on those channels. Thus, I am returning the item for a refund, and suggest you stick with the some of the better inline amps, even though they cost more.",0.0

They don't stay in your ear very well.  I only use them while sitting at my desk & walking around work.  If you plan to wear them doing anything halfway athletic, I suggest wearing a headband over them to hold them in place.

I was prepared for lower quality images indoors without a flash, but the Lumix does not do nearly as well as my Canon Elph in identical lighting situations. The flash is good, but if you want a camera to shoot indoors without flash, be prepared for fairly noisy images with a lot of artifacts.",1.0

"I hooked these up to my Xbox 360 and Xbox One in a cabinet.  Easy to install, looks nice.  The quirk is they keep running after the systems shut down unless you manually turn them off.  I had hoped they would go on and off with the systems being hooked up to the USB connections, but they apparently keep pushing some current even when shut down.  The cords have switches, so easy to turn off manually and not big deal (and probably Microsoft's fault), just a quirk.",1.0

I purchased the M2 SATA SSD Drive several months ago and purchased the enclosure recommended by the store where I purchase the SSD.  This was a mistake as the solder to hold the USB-3 connector to the board in the enclosure failed within 3 months.  I have purchased other Startech products in the past and have never been disappointed so I purchased this enclosure.  I have it for 2 months and use it frequently with no issues.  I use the SSD drive for backup of critical files and transfer of files between my 2 laptops and occasionally use the drive as the file source for file revisions.  The SSD generates heat and the aluminum body plus the vents do a good job of dissipating this heat.  Overall I am very satisfied with the unit and realize that I should have spent the extra money in the first place to purchase a better quality SSD enclosure.",1.0

They *haven't* fallen off, to be clear, and look sturdy enough, but compared to today's luggage that whispers on wheels that spin 360 silently, this wheel attachment seems odious, loud, and rickety-sounding.

I bought it for work and my boss was impressed how I emailed her my notes within five minutes (as long as you write nice). I don't use the voice recording often as I like (serious legal issues if recording conversations so always get an OK before doing it). The audio recordings are superior. Highly impressed.

We had to actually get up from a deep sleep and take the battery out of the useless radio. For several days we tried to get it to work, to no avail.

Great flashlight and a good way to charge your phone if you don't want to leave your phone in a place that may not be secure.  Just charge this little battery and then transfer the charge to your phone.  Also good for extended time away from a plug-in.

"I bought this speaker due to the good reviews I found on Amazon and Youtube.  I am kind of disappointed in the performance of this speaker.  The bass response on this speaker is horrible, possibly the worst I have heard in a portable speaker.  I also own an Amazon basics large speaker but I decided to buy this one to use on deployments since my wife uses the Amazon speaker at home and I honestly could not be more disappointed with it.  I would have returned it if I wasn't deployed.  I watched various review views and the bass response was excellent for the size of the speaker so upon using the speaker for the first time you can imagine my disappointment.  I honestly believe that the speakers that were installed on the reviewers speakers had to be different from the ones currently installed because the difference was so great but I have no way to prove this.  The speaker is loud but you have to turn the bass down so that you don't get distortion.",0.0

"I had bought this TV as the addition to the living room. Although most of our time is spent in other rooms, this TV would be for guest or gaming. I had bought this TV 2 years ago and noticed that once in awhile the TV would turn on, but there was no picture, only sound.  This started happening more and more frequently. I finally dug out my warranty information showing that I had only purchased a one year contract. I decided to contact Vizio Customer Service hoping they have heard of this problem and remedy this with the customers. No luck. I thought Vizio was going to be a great up and coming company. I was wrong. I rather spend the money up front on quality than a cheap fix now.",0.0

"I purchased this item to replace my TP-Link TL SG1008D switch on the theory that it would play well with my new Linksys wrt1900 acs router. I have a cable modem that delivers 200Mb/s to the router that then delivers about 85Mb/s to my computer (two rooms away) over 100tx ethernet cable. Replacing the TP-link with the new Linksys 2800 reduced the pass through to about 20Mb/s. I called Linksys customer support and got no helpful advice. The box did function normally when I connected it directly to the router and then to my computer (thereby bypassing my in-house network) so perhaps this was a failure of its auto-configuration.  Whatever the reason, the box did not come close to the performance of my old switch.  Other comments:  The LEDs showing transmission activity are at the back of the box--hard to see. The instructions for installation were a series of 3 or 4 diagrams that failed to indicate that the router cannot be plugged into ports numbered 5 (or 6) and higher (at least according to what I found on the web)",0.0

Each binder comes with enough sheets to hold 48 discs, though you can buy separate additional pages.

"This radio is absolute crap!  Despite being digital the tune doesn't hold on the station.  It tries to tune in on FM frequencies we don't use here in the US such as 95.6 and a half!  If you tune in a station on FM then switch to AM and tune in a station then return to FM, your FM station is lost.

It feels as if this is an old-fashioned mechanically tuned radio with a pretty digital face.  Finally, the on/off switch doesn't work so the only way to turn it off is to remove the batteries.",0.0
"This is a high quality mouse that relieves wrist pain.  I have owned just about every model of Logitech mouse and this by far is the most comfortable mouse.

Now I have pain using ether hand with the Trackman.  I have a large hand size, it measures 8"" on the chart that I found on the Evoluent mouse website. See added picture for the chart. I love the fact that there are not drivers to install and the mouse was recognized immediately.

Update:  I still like this mouse.  It is not the end of wrist pain for me.  It is a good way to add variety to your input devices.  I still need to use the Trackman and other mice when the pain flares up.",1.0

"I bought this surge protector when I was going to Spain for a couple of months. I once broke a voltage converter on a previous trip to the Iberian peninsula, so I wasn't taking any chances this time. Not only did it protect my computer from all kinds of weird power surges, but it also gave me several much needed additional outlets (Spanish bedrooms, in my experience, only seem to have one or two outlets - not enough, in my opinion!). I also liked the fact that I didn't have to bother with plug converters. You can plug any kind of plug in, and as long as it can handle European voltage, you're all set. I have several appliances with plugs from different countries, and it was nice to be able to plug them all in at once. The cord is nice and long, so if the plug is in a weird spot in your bedroom, you can stretch it across the room (I speak from experience! :) ). Just don't plug it in a 120volt outlet.",1.0

"I wanted some speakers that I could use with my IPAD and IPHONE that were portable but didn't sound cheap.  These speakers are exactly what I was looking for.  They sound much better than those cheap ipad speakers that you get for $10.  They have bass to them, not that tinny sound.  They are pretty loud as well, more than enough for use indoors.  The biggest selling point for me was that they are battery operated and portable.  I have been using the same set of batteries since I bought the speakers about 6 months ago.  The company says they last about 30 hours and I believe it.  The speaker works fine blue tooth and also with an older IPOD that I have to use with a cable.  I use the speakers outdoors now that the weather has gotten warmer and the volume is still fine on my deck watching movies with my IPAD (too loud, I have to turn it down)  and also working in the yard.

Sounds good so far. Haven't had much time to break it in just yet. Cabinet looks good but does have a few scratches. Foam surround on sub has a small chunk missing but it's not all the way through. Appears it may have happened when speaker was mounted to the box and someone slipped when drilling a screw. I have done this myself on a previous build. Doesn't bother me but it probably would most. Decent price for a decent product. It does get loud if that's what you are after. Paired with an denon avrx2000 and polk monitor 75t. Only have a 2.1 at the moment. Will be adding five more speakers soon and most likely another sub.,1.0

"Whether you're camping, on the jobsite, or just working in the yard this is the best little unit I have ever owned. First it is loud enough to hear over power tools. The extra outlets and two USB chargers  are awsome but if you want to run power tools off it plug the unit into power source. I charged it up, plugged in my phone to the USB turned it up full blast and ran it for 36 hrs and it still had one of the four ""dots"" of battery! It is weather proof as I hit it with the hose and left it in the sun to dry while I tested the battery. The sound is really good also. I like the bass that this produces but it has good balance of treble also. The rolling wheels are really nice and rugged but it is light enough to carry upstairs or ridges. I replaced my Bosch work radio and have owned the Milwaukee but this one blows them both away. The FM radio is nice and clear. The light is bright enough to tie a lure when fishing at night. Really glad I bought this.",1.0
"The item arrived within good time, and was well packaged. The VGA pin side was protected by a plastic cover which easily slid off in preparation for use. The product appeared intact with no visible sign of wear and tear. Unfortunately, when tested on multiple computers, it did not work properly. A picture appeared on the desired monitor, but not a clear one by any means. It was black and white with lines running throughout, making any sort of possibility of discerning the picture improbable at best.

The output wasn't that impressive and the sound wasn't that great either (I used the optical output for both players).

"I first purchased this TV a few weeks ago.  After a week or so, I noticed that on certain cable channels (analog, not digital) the audio was out of sync with the video.  This was usually in the range of 0.1 - 0.5 second lead in the audio.  Confused, I watched some movies and it did the same thing.  Thinking it was a problem with the TV, I had the only person I knew with a truck drive 2 hours to my house to bring it back, we brought it back no problem, got the new TV, that person left, and the TV then wouldn't turn on.  Extremely aggrevated, I called the place where I purcahsed it and they agreed to deliver a new one for no charge.  I got the new one and it has the same audio out of sync problem as the original, except sometimes it seems worse.  This happens on the both the HDMI, and component outputs of the DVD player (and yes I did try a different DVD player).

The bios is an absolute mess, there are three different bios screens, all with seemingly the same options just presented completely different for no reason.

"It's not surprising that this is on 'sale' for less than ten dollars. While the keyboard itself worked fine with my tablet, it still took time to adjust to the small keys. In the end I found it easier to use the on-screen keyboard. Like other tablets, I had to press the tabs in to keep the tablet from sliding out all the time; limiting it to a slow creep unless I purposefully push it out of the case.

The biggest problem is that one of the tabs of the case, meant to hold the tablet, actually ended up sliding out of place. This put the tablet askew and more likely to fall out and end up damaged. Another thing to keep in mind is that the stylus is NOT capacitive. This means that it's very possible that it won't work with a tablet screen. So while it works for something temporary, it won't last much longer than a couple of months.",0.0

Second, the quiet noise problem can be easily adjusted by properly setting the volume from the walkman.  If you are getting some type of static, its because your tape deck is crappy and getting interference.
Otherwise, the sound quality is what i expected from a $50 walkman (for those of you who are getting bad sound quality - it may be a headphone problem, go buy better ones) - the earphones that come with the set aren't great, but I wasn't expecting to use them anyways.

"My family has had 3 of these go bad over the past year. Each time we were unable to recover from iTunes ""Back to Factory"" settings. No other way to troubleshoot this particular iPod exists. Yes, it does tell you the error by counting the blinking LED lights, but each time we have not been able to recover it.

"Background: I need to connect my Sennheiser RS120 wireless headphones to my Toshiba 40FT1U HDTV. The TV has just one digital audio out, while the Sennheiser has a RCA analog as well as a coaxial inputs but no digital inputs. Hence the need for this converter.

The packaging was the original packaging of the product and was in excellent condition.

The connections themselves are easy to understand but the included TOSLINK cable was not working for me. Thankfully, I had, accidently, purchased an Amazon Basics Toslink cable which suddenly became useful. Replaced the Toslink cable and voila!, everything was working just fine.
It took me a while to figure out what was actually wrong with the setup (I initially thought it was the headphones) but finally nailed it to the cable.

Overall, I am very satisfied with the product - it does what it says it will, and there is no discernible loss in audio quality. I am no audiophile but I do know a good quality sound thanks to my extensive exposure to Klipsch products.

I may be blaming the headset for a problem with my phones output, if I am, sorry.
One of the features that I like best are the earphones. They are the first that stay in my ears under all situations. On previous sets I have had to go so far as to put tape over my ears, much like a racecar driver, to keep them situated.
I have recommended these headsets to anyone who has asked with the distance from source caveat mentioned above.",1.0

Two of them have either stopped working within months or a mere couple of years or are of poor quality.  This headset puts a lot of pressure on my head and my ears ache after wearing it for more than an hour.  The quality of the voice I hear is not very good, and this is from different computers, on different networks and over several weeks.  It also easily cuts off if I walk away even 10 feet and round a corner (like my cube wall which is only 6' high).  It reconnects, but I lose 3-5 seconds during which I may miss something important someone said on the conference call.

 Well the manufacture had an email address to address what I now consider DECEPTIVE advertisement because of that pesky hidden *, and the fact that it clearly says stereo speakers, so I sent him an email, it has been over a week now and they do not even have the decency to reply to me, so folks do not waste your time..",0.0

"Great case, thought it can look a little plain, the Fractal Design quality has to be seen in person to be appreciated.

The case is immense, and unbelievably heavy--everything just feels SOLID.  Build like a tank, this case has survived moves to 4 different residences.  One big thing you'll notice when you're taking it apart is how solid the side panels are.  On other similarly priced cases, the side panels have a great deal of flex and wobble to them--but these are rock solid.

Can't praise the craftsmanship enough.  Dust filters and sound deadening are icing on the cake for an already flawless chassis.",1.0

"Buyer beware.  LG released an update for this which requires the user to agree to their 'new' privacy policy if you want to use any of the smart tv functions.  This new privacy policy allows LG to collect all your viewing data, as well any file names of attached devices, and send back to LG over your internet.  It's a total crock.  Don't update your tv firmware.  Youtube, Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, etc, all worked before this update.  Now there is no choice but to either not use any of those smart tv functions or agree to let LG mine and sell your user data.

The tv works and is a nice display.  Like all shiny surfaces, it reflects quite a bit in daylight.  The remote is a bit of a pain as it is motion sensitive.

Also, instead of locking the choice in to set colors (most of which I don't like at all) why not give it an RGB control allowing the user to set the color?  The red is too dim, as is the blue, the only yellow has a greenish tint, turquoise is okay but I don't care for it or the purple.  White is okay but again very inconsistent.  The lighting is very uneven, good on some keys bad on others.  The large illuminated Redragon logo is annoying.  I blacked it out.

I do however check my email with it on occasion and play some games.  Which for me is just an added bonus.
The screen quality is awesome, very bright and vibrant.  And the touch screen sensitivity is great as well (now it is very frustrating to try and use the touch screen on my GPS).  The G-sensor is excellent as well.
Also the sound quality on this is excellent.  The music is crisp and clear.  Like I said, listening to music is the main reason I purchased this, so the sound quality was very important.

"I purchased this a Toshiba RD xs34 about 1 month ago.  The first one did not work at all.  Would not record on HDD and would not play DVD's.

Given a replacement which worked from the start but the reds were orange and the dark blues were light blue.

After two weeks the TV Guide quite working and recording manually did not work.  Could set up manually to record but it did not come on or record at the appropriate time.

When you call Toshiba for assistance be prepared for a minimum 20 minute wait.

When I reported the problems with the second machine they wanted me to send it in and they would repair or replace it after looking at it.  In the mean time I would have nothing for $550 spent and less than two weeks of operation.

I am taking it back to the store I bought it from as they have a 90 day satisfaction guarantee.

The remote is not user friendly.  Very poorly laid out menu system.

"I had high hopes for this camera, but I'm returning it.  The camera locked for reasons that I cannot pin down:  occasionally on startup, occasionally after taking a picture and infrequently for no apparent reason.  My camera switched modes, perhaps based upon lighting levels, for example, from auto to a landscape mode, as I panned around a room.  This did not really inspire much confidence in the camera, but I might have been willing to live with the very obvious quirks if the images had been good.  Having said that...

The camera did a poor job of selecting the technical exposure factors, even with pretty easy shots.  The still images that I took were blurry (even with very little subject motion) and noisey in almost every instance.  The video mode was much better, but it was not enough to convince me to keep the camera.

I understand that this is a $200 camera, but mine performed more like a $50 camera.  Color me disappointed.",0.0

IMHO this is the most comfortable, secure and good looking writst strap a person could buy. Who could ask for more?",1.0
"I purchased this product from Amazon with my prime account. I regret this purchase. I have spent many hours, over a four day period trying to get this product to work correctly!

They hang up, do not follow up and offer no ideas on how to correct the problem! They will not issue a RMA number and even if they did they said that they may have to hold the unit they worked out their software problems! If you want a player that will connect to the internet, do not buy this unit. One of the $36.00 units will play your DVD just as well as this unit.

Tried reseting it, and I still get ""Something went wrong"" error message whenever I try to track a workout. Gets even worse as the battery is dying.

"I bought two of these. One had no problems and I loved it. The other had a port that pushed deep into the enclosure when trying to connect a cable. I'm not one to be very patient with weak functionality as a result of flashy aesthetics. The port was glued to the interior of the enclosure to keep it in place, which has a high likelihood of failure, as in my case.

Here is a small 1"" sag that is noticeable, if you're a picky person like me. There is literally no support to stretch and hold the screen at the center. Hence, the reason for the sag.
I love and recommend this screen but be prepare to notice a small flaw in its design!",1.0

"A bit surprised by the abundance of praise for this lens...I suppose people like it for its compactness and use it mostly in the middle of the aperture range. I just bought one and having run a few tests, I can see that it's basically unusable wide open due to severe coma, even in the middle of the frame, and general softness throughout. Both are much improved at the next few stops but not completely gone. Between f/5.6 and f/11 it's very usable, albeit not spectacular, and after that it goes soft again (which is normal for all lenses). I'm less bothered by the chromatic aberration and the barrel distortion, both of which are very noticeable but can be easily corrected in post. I may still keep it to use for street photography but overall I have to say I'm quite disappointed.",0.0
"If you're looking to upgrade to the new STM lens and focusing features of the T5i, then you better run, not walk, from this so called deal.

Then they remove the STM lens and replace it with a standard 18-55mm lens and load you up with a bunch of worthless junk.

"I should have read the reviews carefully. I think people should wait a little longer to make a review instead of judging. This especially applies to products used incredibly often, such as with mice. The scroll wheel, as said by other reviewers, failed and when I emailed the support, they offered a refund of $6, about one-third the price I spent for it ($9.99+ $8.32 S+H=$18.31). Though they say that their warranty lasts a year and my order is within a year (7 months ago to be exact), they wouldn't replace it and offered the $6 refund or a replacement for $4. I wouldn't trust a new one to last so I opted for the refund.

My next purchase will probably be either the Anker mouse or maybe a Logitech trackball mouse but I'm not particular on using a ball or the $30 of the Logitech. I hope the Anker doesn't have the scroll wheel problem but they have an 18 month warranty.",0.0

"Previously owned two Canon's because they had flip-out screens, but we had lots of problems with red-eye. We decided to expand our horizons and try a Panasonic based on the reviews and specs.  Pictures are just okay with no zoom, but it seems that any amount of optical zoom causes awful graininess which is even evident when the pics are sent out for 4x6 prints.  Video is also grainy and the sound records at about half volume--could not find any adjustment for this, so we have to artificially increase the volume in editing software.  I have a really hard time picking which ""scene"" is correct for a good picture, and often lose the opportunity for a shot because I am changing scenes.  Note that I would use the iA mode but this disables some basic options.  Also I can never remember which options are in the quick menu, and which are in the menu menu.  Very aggravating.  For our next camera I think we will go back to a Canon, and just hope their red-eye reduction technology has improved.",0.0

"Nothing but trouble since I bought it. Less than 6 months after purchase and I can't use it on either of my phones. It often wouldn't connect, when it did work it wouldn't stay connected, it would crash and would require me to uninstall and reinstall and set everything back up again. The two-way communication stopped working on my husbands phone; we could never get it to work again and the customer service reps understood very little English so it was never resolved. Today it stopped working on my phone and none of the previous tricks or fixes could get it working again. It was an expensive item for use over such a small amount of time.",0.0

I left the dead tile on my keychain and a few weeks later squeezed it for kicks... and it's working again. Conclusion: unreliable.

During the period I thought it was dead, I googled how to replace the battery. A you tube video showed a long process of sawing it open, soldering connections, and gluing it back together mutilated and ugly.

The fact this was designed to wind up in a landfill violates my fiscal and environmental values. The only saving grace is that it was a gift, so I am a little more comfortable knowing I wasn't the one duped into buying it.

These also stay solidly in place when riding a bicycle or performing gymnastic moves.

"I got this mouse with a wireless microsoft keyboard, and while the keyboard works great, the mouse leaves much to be desired.  It moves the cursor around fine and the laser generally picks up well when using a mousepad.  Without a mousepad you might be in trouble.  The problem is with the scrolling. It sometimes skips and does not always move as you are turning the wheel.  I saw a review that said taking out the batteries fixes this, which it does for a while, but having to take out the batteries is annoying, and only a short term solution.  I would never buy this mouse again knowing what I know now.",0.0

"I had a sony cybershot 8.1 megapixel camera before I had this Olympus.  I actually like the scene features since the cybershot didn't have all the same features as my current Olympus.  The battery life is definitely not as long as my cybershot but I don't mind charging my camera after a few uses.  My Olympus is pretty slim and the battery is really light.  It loads the pictures straight from the XD card onto my computer pretty fast too.  I sometimes have troubleshooting on a fine object and it takes some time to focus with the lens.  I'm use to my cybershot where where I point and shoot and it focuses right away, so it will take some time to get use to.  I have used my Olympus now for about 2 weeks and overall for the price I paid for it it's not too bad at all.  I plan to upgrade in the future but as a college student this is a good camera that is affordable.",1.0
"I cannot recommend this keyboard enough. I got this keyboard for $28.99, and it's the best $30 I have ever spent. To be fair, it is my first wireless keyboard and the first mouse I've owned in 7+ years. I've gotten so used to using a touchpad that I completely forgot how wonderful a mouse is, especially for gaming. Speaking of which, I use this set for Everquest & WoW and it's wonderful and responsive with both. I was excited to find the set is plug & play and only requires one receiver for both devices! Technology, man!!  I do wish it was backlit, as I tend to do a lot of my gaming after my boyfriend goes to bed (I game in bed). I also use this for work--so I'm using these essentially all day. I really enjoy them. The mouse fits comfortably, but I do think it is on the large size (I have tiny hands though as I'm not even 5' tall). The incline of it does give me a cramp after a while. No biggie though.",1.0

I purchased an X7 Plus just over a year ago and found it cut in and out during movement of my body.  It was very sensitive to distance from my phone.  It was surprised by the short Bluetooth range and lack of reliability for the price.  I had to pair the device with a new phone last week and the pairing process fried the electronics in the earbud.  They would not power up or even charge.  I emailed MEE and all they offered was a discount toward a new purchase. I didn't perceive any real interest in customer satisfaction considering the device failed while in pairing mode.  There are less expensive options to consider and I did not feel the product was well engineered or manufactured.  It seemed import grade with domestic pricing.,0.0

"A recent bout with sore fingers on my mouse hand prompted me to switch my pointing device. I am now using different muscles, and my soreness is going away. It takes quite a bit of getting used to, but this trackball is pretty comfortable. The buttons can be a bit of a stretch so folks with smaller hands will want to test this out before buying. Overall good build quality and worth the price.

However, I will still keep a mouse around because this trackball is just not as accurate as a mouse for more precise work like Photoshop or video editing. And the scroll wheel, while nice, scrolls a little too quickly even with settings on their lowest.

One added benefit of a trackball is that if you are a retro-gamer, any games like Arkanoid or Missle COmmand that use a paddle or arcade trackball are a joy play with this device.",1.0

"I'm a first time user of monitor stands. Overall, the WALI Dual LCD Monitor is pretty good. I just installed it in my new desk setup. Initially I was going to rate this lower since out of the box, the horizontal arms come un-leveled, meaning when you mount your monitors, they won't been aligned if they were the same model. In order to resolve that, you have to go back and unscrew the nut cap and use the smallest allen wrench provided and turn the inner key within the bolt counter-clockwise and raise the lower of the two monitors. Somebody mentioned it earlier but I had to do my research and go back to the manual (never throw those suckers away). Additionally, when the product arrived, there were slight scratches to the top of the vertical bar, but unnoticeable after setup.

Lastly, you have to be slightly aggressive with the bars to get them where you want as they're pretty static. Make sure to toy play around with them to get a feel before setting your monitors. It wasn't easy but I'd rather have them this way than loose on their axis.",1.0

Cons: button placement is odd, and Bluetooth reception is absolute garbage. In any position my phone is in, either in my back pocket or front belt--the connection pops and is mildly annoying. However, once I turn my head 10 degrees to the left the connection begins to crap out. I've left the phone on a bench and did pushups next to it and the connection was garbled.

Also the alarm is very low without any adjustment. We now have to get up by the music side because that is adjustable.?.?

"NOT COMPATIBLE WITH WINDOWS 10!  I bought one of these five years ago and I've loved having it.  It's very reliable and effective, although I did read that there was a flaw in the software that exposed the user passwords, so I suppose that eliminates the effectiveness, but for me, I just need something to lock my screen and I don't work with anyone who can figure out how to exploit this weakness so it wasn't a problem.  Eikon was bought by Apple a couple of years ago in order to use their technology in their products, but they then left Eikon's customers out in the cold, I don't think there's been an update to their software for this product, which is necessary to run it, since 2012.  It's gotten harder and harder to find the software as a legacy offering and now I've discovered that the software will not work with Windows 10.

"Been looking for a good pair of wireless headphones for running that sound great and most importantly stay on my ears.

I used to own Jaybirds which were horrible and way overpriced.

These are just what I needed.  Now these won't replace a pair of $300 Bose, but they give me just enough rich bass to pump up my runs.

They clip over the ear which at first they are awkward to put on but after a few times it becomes second nature and they stay put! Ran 8 miles with them today and never felt like I needed to adjust them once.

Deducted a star because there is some slight skipping as I ran but that may be from keeping my phone in my water bottle pouch. It's not a showstopper by any means and many other Bluetooth headphones have the same issue.

"This is the worst keyboard I've ever used. First off it constantly misses letters while typing. I can be typing a sentence and it will always skip at least one letter somewhere in every sentence I type, which results in so many typos and misspelled words. I have to constantly proof read everything to find all the letters the keyboard skipped. Secondly, while this keyboard isn't the loudest I've ever used, it should by no stretch of the imagination be considered quiet. One of the main reasons I purchased this keyboard was so I wouldn't have to listen to the loud clicking by the keys on my old keyboard. This one isn't much better. It was reviewed as one of the quietest keyboards on the market. Well if that's the case, then the market sure has changed, because I've owned much quieter keyboards over the years.

"I had a Timex Ironman T5K395 that worked pretty well for 2 years before the chest strap stopped sending (the watch still seems to function).

I cleaned the contacts on the chest strap and replaced the battery but still no go so have sent it back to Amazon.  I'll give the Timex T5K719 a try and hope it's not a lemon, too.
 BTW: if the alarm is important to you -- as it is for me since I frequently exceed a safe maximum HR -- be aware that the alarm on the T5K738 isn't audible in most environments unless you exercise with your wrist in your ear.

"Awful. The watch itself seems OK. Its what to be expected for a replica. Really watered down.
That's not the problem.
First. The Bluetooth disconnects every 5 min or so. Disconnects more when you link your calls, and not just straight Bluetooth. This get redundant if it doesn't stay connected.
Second, the battery is not held in by anything. It just sits there. It continuously falls off. There is no clips, no clasp...nothing.
A simple tap, and the battery falls off, even when on your wrist. You risk losing the battery, also its annoying because it shuts off every time it pops out.

So the negative out of the way. The band is durable, and the watch seems durable as well.
NOT WATER PROOF OR WATER RESISTANT.

"I got this because I liked the fact you could see how much mah were left on the battery and you could individually charge a battery. I have a tone of batteries in use around the house, kids toys and my camera flashes, probably around 40+ in total. I got mostly tired of having to change out my sons thomas the train toys every other day or so. I did an individual refresh on all the batteries and now his thomas the train toys last about 5 days solid before they actually die!

On another note, because I can now see how much mah there is left on a battery, the batteries that I put in Thomas the train's, one of the batteries still had at least 25-50% mah left. So I'm thinking the OEM battery charger which requires 2 batteries at a time, stops charging when one of the batteries in the pair gets fully charged even though the other isn't at full capacity yet.",1.0

So, you start off with an iffy light source and the loss of image and resolution -- no thanks! It is also not exactly rugged material in construction, either.
If you do get this, the best light source seems to be a light box (which I don't have) or setting your computer monitor to a blank word processing page and adjusting the monitor's brightness. On the other hand, experimenting with various light sources (color and intensity) could create a whole new avenue for manipulating the results, but I'd rather do that in Photoshop, etc.

"Pros:
Decent sound for the price.
Nice little case
Comes with different sized rubber replaceable ear bud tips. And one set of memory foam tips.

Cons:
Cord is plastic coated and very springy. It will never straighten out and gets twisted up all the time.
The cord is noisy when moving around. Don't use these while running, the cord will make a lot of noise in the ear buds.
After about 6 months they're falling apart on me. I'm getting shocked in my ear when I stand up with the earbuds plugged into my laptop.
Just today the right earbud opened up and I quickly snapped it back together, but something must have came loose on the inside because I'm getting no sound in the right ear now.",0.0
"I bought my 32 GB Zune HD two years ago and it still works flawless.  I haven't ran out of room, picture quality for video is awesome.  I am a huge Microsoft fan and will never buy an Apple product, you know why?  Because Apple is overpriced and Microsoft offers us similar products (some of them even better) as Apple with cheaper prices.  Even though I payed $170 for mine and it's $350 now, if mine broke or got stolen somehow I would buy another one because they are worth every penny they cost.  I don't use it much right now because I'm home 24/7 but my fiance takes it to work with her and uses it all night while she works, she loves it.  It does everything the Ipod touch does, but cheaper.

Sure it can - but how often should we expect it to happen?  The device is rather interestingly labeled: ""designed in California, USA - manufactured in China"".

"Misleading advertising that says ""connect any USB drive"" caused me to buy this adapter directly from Addonics. Shipping took a week.

I connected my 2 MyBooks to it and nothing worked. The web-based administrator's page errored out the drives although it identified one as a ""MyBook"".

Email colloquy yielded knowledge that only Addonics drives work with the adapter and that one adapter is needed for each drive, but when I asked for an RMA number to return the adapter, the emails fell silent.

I got through to their telephonic customer service and a snotty agent said I was out of luck. I had to use Addonics drives and I had to format then through the adapter. The agent informed me of a 15% restocking fee which I said I will not pay because Addonics misled me with its bogus advertising. The agent said, ""Too bad, you'll have to be docked the 15%."" I responded that I will dispute the purchase through my credit card and that is exactly what I did. I shipped the adapter back to Addonics.

I returned the product after speaking with a customer service representative at the beginning of the month and as of today am still waiting for my refund. Not satisfied with the product or customer service I've received.",0.0

"I bought this camera, the Kodak Easyshare V1073, to replace my old digital Polaroid, yes Polaroid, camera. I wanted something made in this century and a major upgrade, and I think I got both. The touch screen definitely makes using this camera so much easier then having to press a million buttons to do anything like most of the standards on the market.

Pros: Touchscreen makes everything easier, explanations for the different modes are in camera, smart capture takes out the guess work, great macro shots, image stabilization works like a dream; your subject could spin like a Tazmanian devil, and it still takes a great still shot.

Cons: Touch screen is practically INVISIBLE in sunlight. You have to hold your hand over the screen to make it out. The battery door is flimsy. Lense stays out every time your turn the camera on. Must charge battery in camera.

Buy this camera if you are a point and shoot fan, and you want something a little fancier then what's currently out.",1.0

"Surprisingly good picture; especially at night.  I have an aftermarket system that gives me a small picture in my rearview mirror.  The camera went out and all it needed was a simple swap of cameras.  I had to modify one pin connector to work with my current system ($5 part).  The new camera is far better than the old one.  I wouldn't call it HD as advertised, but really good.  The night vision (although not equipped with actual night vision like some are) is very good.  My week reverse lights is all it needs to give me a decent picture.  Well worth the extra few bucks (there are many cheaper versions out there, although I don't have experience with them, so...).  I'm not a fan of the grid it overlays on the picture, but am keeping it for now.  It's easier enough to get rid of if you wish (snip the white looped wire).",1.0

It has been a saving grace on my ergonomic wrist pain since my physical therapy for RSI back in 2001.  I can't use any other mouse now, it makes perfect sense to keep your arm and wrist still and just roll your thumb around for the cursor and use your fingers to click and scroll.  I do prop up the palm end of the mouse on a wrist pad/bump to better the wrist position when I'm mousing.  Actually, this allows just my palm to rest on the mouse and my wrist is floating, not in contact with any surface to alleviate any pressure or friction injury relating to RSI or carpal tunnel.

After I gave up and took it off, my PS4 would no longer display a picture through HDMI when hooked up directly to my TV and it was working before I hooked it up through this splitter.  Long story short, my PS4 had to be sent off for repairs because luckily, it's under warranty.  It's just a mighty strong coincidence that I hooked it up though this device and my PS4 decides to die.

The biggest issue is the adhesive
It says to fully teat unit before removing the adhesive because its non returnable afterwards
The problem is you cant test the adhesive which is subpar
In less than a week after install the bottom edge popped off and would lift easily.
I have used a heat gun on it a couple times and sat heavy items on it to try and set the adhesive with little luck.

The only minus (and reason I took away a star) is that the color of the letters on the keys are nearly impossible to see (I bought the black version... in the pictures the letters are white, on the actual keyboard they are an extremely dark grey). Not a big deal for me, since I am mostly a touch typist, but I could see it being a problem for some people.",1.0

So I got another pair. They sound exactly the same as I remember when mine were fresh and new. I am a recording engineer with a very acute memory for sounds. They are clear and fairly deep. They have some brittleness or sharpness in the treble, but it's not terrible. It gives them a perceived resolution which is greater than I suspect the really should have. Sound blockage is also very good unless you are eating corn chips ;). They are also some of the most comfortable cans I've worn.

"This bowl has transformed my kitchen/living room! I live in a tiny apartment and was getting so so so frustrated having to wipe up the drips and drops off of my white tile kitchen floor every single time my incredibly adorable Basset mix hubert would slurp up water. Not to mention if i wasn't on top of it he'd get his cute- but, freshly walked, sometimes muddy/dirty paws in the water drops and then my entire white kitchen floor was riddled with dirty black paw prints. I ordered this bowl on a whim and it works 100% . not only does Hubert now take time with his drinking instead of gulping down so much water and practically choking, he doesn't leave a pesky water trail around the house.

The clamps are key. As long as you can screw the clamps in they'll keep the unit in place.

"Well, the reviewer below gave the 560 a 1 star rating because it only came with 1 6-Pin PCI-E adapter, and apparently his power supply doesn't even come with one standard, when most modern power supplies over 450w come with at least 1. This is the reasoning I'm thinking as to why ASUS only gave one PCI-E adapter, yes two would be nice, but in this day and age, most gamers have beefy PSUs with at least 2 6-Pin PCI-E connections standard, and most regular PSUs come with 1 already :-)

Anyways, back to the card review. I bought this at $184 with a $20 rebate, and at that price, it was as steal. This is FERMI architecture on the cheap!

"This laptop gets real hot, though that is a testament to AMD Athlon chips which notoriously consume more power than Pentium chips.  Since the CPU is always running so hot, it always sets off the fan, which seems to go off every 2-3 minutes with light web browsing, and is almost constantly on when doing anything more intensive.  The schizophrenic nature of the fan is noticeable and somewhat loud compared to sound level of any Pentium notebook I have ever heard.

Also, the hinge design is very poor.  I have had laptops in the past with similar hinge covers that broke off after about 12 months of use- why can't these guys just make metal hinge covers like IBM???

"I was looking for new earbuds because I've had a number of similar ones that kept breaking with use.  I asked a friend with Samsung earbuds if she liked them, and she said they didn't give her any problems  they were the pair she had received with her phone.  I was just looking for something with decent sound quality (not even great), and something that wouldn't break easily.

The sound quality on these was much poorer than my friend's pair, and it was difficult to even understand conversations over the phone.  The first pair broke within a few weeks.",0.0

"I am updating my previous review of this product.  I originally gave it five stars.  It is a great little case and does a wonderful job of protecting my external drive when I travel.  I would certainly purchase it again if I ever need another case.  I deleted one star because I do not believe it is really waterproof.  I do believe it is water resistant and it will protect your drive in rain, maybe even a downpour, however, if it is ever submerged, I do not believe the zipper would keep water out for very long.  So don't scuba dive with it, or drop it in your pool and you should be just fine.  I love it!!",1.0

"This is purely for aesthetic, If you're looking at this product you probably had the same mindset as I did, to be different, to stand out from the other photographers and their ""bland"" black backpacks. However doing so I soon figured out that this backpack is pretty useless for a camera backpack. everything is very awkwardly shape so it annoys you when you put stuff in and out of the bottom compartment. I soon got very annoyed and just used the top half of the backpack and just put my camera in there, completely defeating the purpose of a camera backpack and making this more of a ""utility overall"" backpack.",0.0

We have purchased 6 Nikon digital cameras over the last 5 years.  We've been pretty happy with all of them so we keep buying Nikon even after looking closely at Cannon and Sony.  We started with a 3 MP and have graduated over the years.  This one is the best so far on picture quality.  It has a nice large screen and is slim and easy to pocket.  We purchased this one to replace a 4 MP Nikon because it was painstakingly slow to recharge between flash pictures and the lag time for click to shutter release was frustrating.  I'm happy to report that this one is far better in both respects.  The only drawback is the lack of a regular viewfinder.  Unfortunately that seems to be the case in all the entry level cameras regardless of brand these days.,1.0

Some of my tips would be to definitely read the instructions, don't assume you can figure it out like I tried. Don't worry about eye relief until you have it attached to the telescope or what have you, then you can easily move your phone back and forth without completely messing it up. If your phone camera has a ""pro mode"", definitely get used to what every setting does. Also, you might be able to use headphones with a play button to take pictures. That will keep you from shaking the whole telescope. You could also try setting a timer.",1.0

"Very cool looking little speaker. Got this as a deal of the day for $29.99 and at that pricepoint, I love it. Super convenient and super easy to use. My biggest gripe would be with the sound quality. It's not terrible but i'd be disappointed with it if I had paid more than probably 50 bucks for it. Poor bass and high end treble. Having said that, I realize you get what you pay for so I'm not unhappy with it.

Bottom line is, this isn't a substitute for a stereo system but works great as a sound source for a workshop, use in the yard, or while traveling/outdoors thanks to its portability and ease of use.",1.0

"I have used Altec Lansing speakers both personally and, occasionally, professionally for the last 50 years. I have always been pleased with them - until this set.

While I no longer have my test equipment, I still have my reference headphones for comparison, and I must concur with the reviewers who hated these speakers. They remind me of the ""early"" days of bookshelf speakers, when the goal was to make ""spectacular"" sound, with emphasized bass and treble, rather than delivering smooth, flat response.

The bass must be turned waaaay down to the bare minimum for anything resembling flat response, and the tweeters go shrill when there is any high frequency signal. Even worse is a huge, deep hole in the midrange - right where human voices lie. The result is that the more you listen to them, the more you hate them.

Frankly, I prefer my 10-year-old $20 Labtec speakers. Since I can no longer return them, I will donate the AL speakers to Goodwill. I pity whoever buys them.",0.0

"Purchased this 5-in-1 reflector set (32 inch round version) for a kindergarten class photo shoot that I did last week.

With this, you now have the ability to direct or filter the sunlight as needed. Living the the Pacific Northwest, the weather/sunlight is unpredictable to say the least. The photoshoot was right around lunchtime, so the sun was out in full force. My assistant was able to hold up the white filter and disperse/soften the harsh sunlight over the subject's face. This made a world of difference. We also used some of the reflective sides as the sun was beginning to angle behind the subject.

My order did not come with any instructions, but being computer savvy I had no issues installing this. Booted it up and worked without issues. Not only would I recommend this product, I have already recommended this to several people as an option to upgrade to a smaller SSD due to pricing strictly for a boot drive and then utilize the factory drive for your home folder with the help of this adapter.",1.0

This worked both with the tablet and the keyboard when plugged into the original Asus plug however when partnered with the Amazon Basics USB 2amp plug it would only charge the tablet but not the keyboard.

Allows me to browse via a fast wifi connection, import/export via USB, project to projectors, run apps like ESPN/Netflix/etc, also MS office, watch videos, listen to music (including bluetooth output to external systems/speakers).  It's pretty lightweight compared to my beast of a laptop before this.  As far as accessories, I haven't used the stylus much but would strongly recommend a keyboard add-on.  My only minor complaint is that the power supply cord is starting to tear up but after 3 years it's about the same length of time as the power supplies of my past 2 laptops.",1.0

"I purchased this headset because I work from home and use my iPhone for business conference calls.  I use the headset daily weekdays for about 6 hours a day (on average).  I purchased the headset March 4, 2016 and by May 10th, 216 the headset is already not working as it should.  Any slight movement of the cord cuts off calls, the white connector piece they provide to connect the headset cord to the iPhone headset jack stopped working completely.  The earpiece sound quality went from a 10 to a 2 and it now sounds like people are whispering when they are talking normally so I cannot hear them.  Whenever I speak the sound is choppy or muffled.  I suspect it is bad cord/connectors but since the headset has no warranty and cannot be returned after 30 days I am now out my $30 and only got 60ish days of use out of the headset.

"This review is purely for the camera - not the seller. The camera is extremely slow and laggy - it lags when trying to take a photo even when the light is more than adequate (outdoors), and it lags when taking the photo so any action comes out blurry. It also lags when trying to find the focal point of your image so by the time the camera has registered where the focus should be, the moment is gone already. It lags after taking the photo - it takes moments for the photo you've just taken to show up on the screen. It even lags when you press the play button to review the photos. Taking photos at night without a flash? Don't even try it. I'm so disappointed in this camera and returned it after trying it out for a day.",0.0

  Beware. The packaging and product looked (and sounded) legit, but it was not. I was very disappointed in Amazon to say the least; It's one thing to be had by an independent seller, but these headphones were sold BY Amazon.
  I was just outside of Amazon's return window, but after contacting them with the issue, I was able to return the product for a refund minus a restocking fee, which I think should have been waived seeing as they sold me a counterfeit product. I hope this review helps someone make a better decision than I did.",0.0

Not sure how this product can claim to be ipod/ipad compatible when there aren't any volume controls on the inline switch. This is as basic as air conditioning in a modern car in Phoenix.

Great portable radio. Bought item for a gift and the recipient is using it weekly without any trouble and is very happy wirh it. I recommend product.,1.0
The description of this item said it suctions to windshield. It is an adhesive backing. The lady TomTom base I had also has an adhesive. When I went to sell my car it left a bad residue after taking of the base. Which is why I wanted suctioning not an adhesive. If I would have known it had an adhesive backing I would not have purchased it.,0.0
"The headphones work great, only problem is the material and construction... THEY SUCK! I have gone through 2 pairs of these now, the first one last all sound in one ear bud after 2 months of use and the most recent one lasted 3 weeks before the battery went out and wouldn't hold a charge. I would not trust these as they are not built to last, but rather, built to try and make it past the 1 month mark so they can keep their money.

It is hard to find a wireless headphone that will wrap around your ear without covering it up, so these were originally appealing to me, but please please please, save yourself the headache of having to worry about if your headphones will work when you get to the gym and pay the extra for a good brand name that won't screw you over",0.0

"The product does not work, for the most part. I plugged it into my computer, and set it as the microphone and headphones. The headphone jack works, but the mic is not. I tried with my Mac and PS3, and none work. What annoys me is that the port isn't totally dead. It picks up static, increasing in pitch the louder the noise I make.

I got this primarily for the mic port, since the one on my PC is all the way on the back.
I also had another one identical that worked for the PS3, but this was cheaper. I suppose I'll re-buy the previous one I had before.",0.0

"I just received my Bose headphones and I was so excited. My old Beats headphones were getting old the headset pad kept falling off and the padding was not as soft. In addition I got a great deal on Prime day.  Sadly, despite the Bose name, these headphones are substantially inferior to the Beats that I guess I am spoiled by.  I am hardly an audiophile but I can really hear the difference. The Bose just are not as clear and the sound is not as full nor is the bass as good. I was really hoping for a good replacement for the old headphones but now I have to decide whether to return them or settle for inferior sound. A positive feature is the Bose are more comfortable for long periods than the Beats since they go around the ear and not on it.  Another negative is the volume control seems really cheap.",0.0

"This is a really cool toy...it is thin plastic and batteries but really fun. I got it as a modern equivalent to the old ""ViewMaster"". Near to things (like tourist attractions) it takes a nice 3d picture (really its 2 digital pictures) and stores on a standard SD card (took it from my ""normal"" camera). After playing around, I did print out the 3d pictures from the card on photo paper and it worked; with the cardboard glasses ""viewer thing"" you can really see 3d. Kids love it.  If the ""viewer"" was made thick like the ViewMaster it would be wonderful, and not so much a toy.  Still it's a fun thing and maybe a good ""teen gift"". Not good as a camera (about like most cell phone cameras - no flash) and not for motion. so I still use my 14 MegPix digital.",1.0

"I'm on my third K750, and I just can't find anything I like as well. The amount of travel in the keys is modern but satisfying, with just enough click. And Logitech seems to be the only company who understands my need for a number pad on my wireless keyboard.

The solar charging is a fantastic idea, and gets you through a couple of years without changing the battery. The battery does eventually need to be changed, which used to be a real hassle. But they've made that easier to do in the more recent models.

The only inconvenience is that I have had two of them die. The first was my fault, from a coffee spill. But my second keyboard just keeled over without warning or provocation when it was only three months old.

Fortunately, Logitech has a three year warranty. I didn't realize such a thing still existed. Registering the product and requesting a warranty replacement was super easy and pretty fast. A serial number, uploaded receipt, and description of what happened was all they needed to send me a working replacement.",1.0
"I bought one of these and returned it in one week.  The remote has to be aimed directly at the machine to the point of being a pain.  The machine takes about 2 seconds to respond to most commands adding to the frustration and has a generally cheap feel and sound.  Overall reception and video quality are OK, not great.  And what made me return this unit was when I read reviews about how often they break down.  I exchanged it for a Panasonic DMRES15, which cost less money, and within the first 10 minutes it was obviously a far superior machine.  Overall operation was smoother and quieter and the remote is fantastic!  The Panasonic will also handle DVD-RAM and came with a blank disc!  Philips does not.",0.0

"While there seems to be some confusion as to what this product is or isn't, here is my opinion.
I do consider this a Bluetooth Clock Radio because it is a Bluetooth radio with a clock. True enough, you cannot use the Alarm feature to play your music via Bluetooth, but to be honest I never imagined it would. It pairs easily with my phone and the BT seems to work flawlessly. The only downside in my opinion is the charger option does charge, but it is not a ""fast charger"" like I normally use on my phone. That being said, this does make for a nice bluetooth speaker for the bedside (don't expect concert quality audio) and indeed includes an alarm clock if you need that. I can see this replacing two items for people who have both. Personally, I use my phone for the alarm anyway (as I'm sure many others do these days) so what this product gave me was a bluetooth speaker with a clock. I used to just press the button on my phone to check the time, now I can just look at the clock.",1.0

"Most of the tools are decent and functional. The problem which is a big problem and the entire reason for giving it only two stars is. The screw driver is polished and very very thin. Being thin can be a good thing as it allows you to get into tight spaces the problem is the combination of thin and lacking any way to grip it. Rendering it impossible to remove tight screws. To make this screw driver functional you need to texture the handle with something like a dremel tool. The rest of the tools including the bits are fine, not the best but more then good for small electronics.",0.0

"The headset is working fine. There is only one serious design flaw that was worth removing 3 stars from my review. The power button and call button is the same multi-function button. Short press and you're calling the last number. Long press and you're turning the headset off. So on several occasions I was accidentally dialing someone at night, instead of just turning off the headset... For once I don't understand why there is a need for a call button on the headset at all. Second, if there is a need, why is it necessary to combine 2 buttons in one. There is a whole other side free of buttons, and it would be logical to move the power button to that free side.",0.0

"It is a great tablet and feels very solid.  There is some light bleed but you truly can not notice it unless you have a plain black screen just sitting there showing nothing but a pure black image. I do not know of anyone who does that.
I have been using the Nexus line for a while and the price came as a shocker consider the Nexus 7 was so cheap and honestly probably the best tablet, besides the iPad, that was ever built. I got it on sale from amazon with a $50 discount and a $50 Google play credit. That made the purchase easier to swallow.

"The hearing sound comes in decent, but the problem with this style of headset is an earbud and so the microphone is far away from my mouth.  I tested the unit on two phones and you have to talk loudly in order to hear the person talking.

For that I can't recommend earbud style headsets unless they have a strong microphone.",0.0

Aside from that, the keyboard looks great, and I loved the palm rest. But as a keyboard, where the Natural Elite excelled, this one failed. Ended up going with a Perrix as a close replacement for the Natural Elite.

"This thing is great, insanely low temperatures even with high overclocks. I'm running a i7 6700K at 4.7Ghz and my max load temp is 81c (room temp at 23c) and idle is about 27-28c. I was using a cooler master hyper 212evo, and it's much louder than the 3.0 here.
 The RGB lights are pretty cool, you can pick about any color you want or turn them off too. The fan controler is pretty simple to use as well and attaches with included Velcro pads.
Assembly and installation was pretty simple, but the instruction manual could be improved with words and not just pictures. It took me about 30-40 minutes to install the unit in my tower. (Your time may vary.)
I do think $180 is a little to much, but the performance is great, and it's much cheaper and simpler than the complicated open loop systems.

Pros: great temps, good looks and pretty quiet.

Cons: Expensive. Pretty large, you really need a big full tower case.",1.0

"Perfect for organizing your CF cards.
 Put it in your back pocket if you're the kind of person who's shooting weddings, or keep it in your camera bag. There are only four CF card pockets, but thats enough for most people. Even when shooting a large event like a wedding where you're capturing a couple thousand images, this helps keep you organized and efficient.

This little Pocket Rocket offers mild protection for all of your memory cards. Its not water proof, but most CF and SD cards are, so this is perfect for keeping large grimy bits off of the metal connector pins.

It also has a card/Identification window on the back, so you can keep track of everything and let everyone know that its yours.

"Picked up 2 of these last year & have used them sporadically.  Most recently used at a wedding inside a really dark cabin-style building, dark walls, high dark ceiling & lighter floors.  Used this on speedlite mounted to a bracket shooting in portrait.  The center of this unit sat 12"" above the center line of lens, & worked really well for the conditions that presented.  If you keep an eye on your f-stops & balance ambient coming in through shutter control i think the results can be quite rewarding. Sure it looks a little goofier than the Lightsphere but image quality once controlled was very predictable. Would definately recommend.",1.0

I have treated both pairs with absolute kid gloves (carefully wrapping them up, but not too tightly, and storing them in the provided case).

Etymotic replaced my first pair after they crapped out at about 1 year old.  The replacement pair is going on almost 1.5 years but, like I said, is about to die.  The wires inside the insulation are now visible.  This second set would have actually died 6 months ago if I had not wrapped a frayed section in duct tape.

"I bought this from Amazon, it arrived, I used it to try to fix two discs.  The product seems to work only closer to the center and does not do much on the outer 3/4"" or so.  It has you use a solution in one of the steps and you are suppose to put on 2 or 3 drops, which I did.  I placed the disc back into the machine as instructed.  After the required 3 minutes of spinning I opened the cleaning unit and removed my disc.  One of the drops had not even been touched.  So, not only is it not fixing my disc, it can't even remove a drop of fluid.

  Also, there was some kind of contamination on one of the discs.  It looked like a stain about 1/4"" across and I was hoping this device would clean it off.  It didn't.  Having nothing to loose, I put some Windex on it, rubbed gently, and the spot went away.

"Disappointing Father's Day gift. This was a great surprise to my husband who was not expecting Bluetooth headphones.

Pros- looked nice, comfortable, connected to Bluetooth easily
Cons- no consistent sound on the side with the buttons

"I bought this from the Microsoft store, and I fared better than people here in that it lasted more than four weeks before it couldn't boot up anymore. Took it to the store and the computer was not able to recognize its own hard drive. Luckily, I was still eligible for a refund through Microsoft.

If I did not have the booting issue, I would still give it four stars. It was a well-designed laptop that was fast and productive, but there were other issues (waking up from sleep mode, a keyboard that would miss inputs occassionally, etc.). I have been a fan of ASUS for years, but based on my experience and other reviews I am seriously questioning the quality of their products.

I bought a couple of these because I had some 2.5"" devices sitting around.  Unfortunately they don't work in EVERY USB 3.0 port.  The ports on the fronts of my desktop machines seem to have an especially hard time.  Because of the short cables this is a real problem.  I'm wondering if a USB 3.0 hub with it's own power would help here.  One bright spot: my HP laptop has no trouble driving a disk in these enclosures, so they are not completely useless.  I'm tempted to blame the cables that bring the USB 3.0 ports to the fronts of the desktop machines.  But Seagate and HGST portable drives work fine, so the power must be there.

To be fair, this combo is nice: the color is beautiful, and the HDMI cable is of good quality. But when these good qualities come with a bad adapter, the result is a bad shopping experience. Considering it will cost me more to return, I will keep them as a reminder: good things don't come cheap.

"I have had several other projectors including 2 different Optoma projectors.  This projector is great.  Easy to mount.  The picture is very bright even in a lit room.

"At first I loved my Sony pocket reader. I never had any problems downloading books, there was no glare on the screen and I never felt like I had eye strain like you get with a computer.  After 7 months though my reader flat died. Sony customer service was very nice and they replaced my reader without any hassle for a small fee (I think it was like $25).  Normally I am not the type of person to write a bad review and I realize electronics can fail from time to time. My replacement reader was the next model up, a touch edition, which I was never happy with, last night again after I have had it about 6 months it also died.

"This Sony Bluetooth receiver was initially one of the best I've tried. In particular, it seemed to reconnect to previously paired devices quite quickly. Sound quality was about as Bluetooth gets. Unfortunately, after about 6 months of use, the 3.5mm headphone jack started to go bad. With the headphone cable inserted to full-depth, the SBH20 would only deliver sound to one ear. I tried several different pairs of headphones and earbuds and the result was always the same. It was nice while it lasted, but it's sitting in the garbage now.

"These were my first pair of Bluetooth headphones, so I wanted to start off with something cost effective to see if I liked the technology. At first, I noticed that the headphones are comfortable, provide a nice sound and a microphone works effectively. However, I quickly noticed a cutting in and out of sound with the pair I received. The sound would play, but every 30 seconds to 1 minute, there would be a 1-second silence before sound would resume.

Fortunately, the company reached out to me to see how I liked the product. I gave them the feedback and they quickly replaced the pair for me.

The new pair seems to be working splendidly so far. No issues. Overall, I would recommend these headphones if you're looking for a solid pair of Bluetooth headphones at a reasonable price. They customer support was quick and effective, and I can certainly appreciate that. The battery lasts for about 6 hours it seems and I haven't had an issue so long as I recharge every other day or so.

"This OmniMount wall shelf is great! This product is inexpensive, stylish and practical. It is extremely easy to assemble and mount. I mounted it in an area of my bedroom where space is limited. Instead of mounting it to the studs, I mounted it to an area of the wall that is hollow, using anchor plugs and screws. As you can see from the pictures, I have a DVD player and a cable box on the shelf and it is holding up very well.

Additionally, the black glass feature is extremely practical to the extent that if you chose to mount this shelf in a high area, you would not be able to see the bottoms of your components underneath and through the glass. The cable management system is also a big plus. Another attractive feature is that the shelf sits close to the wall (unlike the OmniMount ECSB Component Shelf for CRT TVs & Video Accessories, which protrudes much too far from the wall). I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a space saving wall shelf solution.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Omnimount-Tria-1-B-1-Shelf-Wall-Furniture-Black-Dark-Glass/dp/B001DMJ49C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Omnimount Tria 1 B 1-Shelf Wall Furniture (Black/Dark Glass)</a>",1.0

"Works great with Motorola V551 and Razr V3. The one I received looks like the photo supplied by Valerie Holifield, and not like the stock photo. It also comes with a nice dark blue rubber dust cap for the USB connector.

Worked with no problems for copying MP3's and JPEGs to a Motorola V551 and Razr V3. It also paired with a Motorola A1000, but unfortunately the A1000 didn't support the file transfer profile.

I only had to learn about how the pairing sequence works, along with understanding how the passkey works. But some of the other reviews here are very helpful for learning how the whole process is supposed to work.

I couldn't get Mobile Phone Tools to recognize it at all. I eventually gave up after many tries, and used a mini USB cable from my Canon digital camera instead for use with Mobile Phone Tools. Still give it 5 stars, since it's probably Mobile Phone Tools that is quirky or is designed only for use with the Motorola-branded Bluetooth dongle.",1.0

"Great system.  Good volume, sound quality, material quality, cable quality.  Responsive, speakers are crisp and rich.  Sub is crisp and punchy but smooth.

Pros: Good sound quality. 5.1 surround. Good material quality.  Separate bass control.  Headphone jack.  Simple, color-coded setup.  Very responsive.  Really brings games to life.

Cons: Matrix function (generates ""surround sound"" from Stereo input) generates fluctuating signal for rear speakers that is muddy and cuts out.  Tends to reduce overall sound quality for other speakers.

Overall: Good buy.  For best results, you'll need a 5.1 surround sound card or 3 to 1 stereo splitter (poor man's version of surround sound). Leave the Matrix function alone.

"The mount works well enough, but the thumbscrew at the base, which attaches to the mic stand, is atrocious. It cannot tighten firmly enough to hold the mount in a stable position.

Really awful, and it seems to be a common problem. If they replaced that screw with one made of better material, it would be a quality product.",0.0

"From the pictures I thought it was going to be faux crappy leather but was so surprised when I received the item and it may be faux leather but it's pretty good and it even smells like the real thing (maybe it is).  It fit perfectly to my Nexus 7 2nd gen.  the Magenta is more of a hot pink but i guess it was too girly to call it that so Magenta=Hot Pink and I love it.  The handle on the back is very helpful, love the magnetized quality which turns it on and off.  the stitching is of good quality.  Fits all the nooks and crannies of the Nex 7 2nd gen.  Feels like it could withstand a bump here and there and protect the tablet, doubt is waterproof but looks like it would be easy to clean.  The stand form is a bit cumbersome having to take off half the case so that it can fold and hold the tablet in landscape mode but it's not a deal breaker.  In conclusion, these pics don't do justice to the quality of the product, I can see me buying a different color once i'm over the hot pink.",1.0

"To be clear, I was extremely happy with the headphone when they worked properly.

Pros
-The pairing process worked reliably and consistently.
-The sound quality was great as far as I was concerned
-The construction seemed sturdy enough
-capacitive touch wheel was great after getting used to it.

Cons
-Occasionally the wireless audio would cut out when the phone was pressed up against my leg in my pocket, but I found this to be a product of the phone on other wireless headphones too.
-After owning the headphones for a couple of months, the wireless audio started to malfunction. When paired via bluetooth, the audio only works on the left side speaker of the head phones. The same behavior can be seen when trying to use the audio over USB. However when using the aux cable, both speakers appear to work again.

I am frustrated because after contacting Jabra, they would assist me because the device was purchased used via amazon. The only reason I purchased them used was because I thought I was buying a quality product. Unfortunately this will be the last set of Jabra headphones I own.",0.0

"I have used this units little brothers, the GTX 735 for a couple years now; I imagine the 1000 is a little improved, but the power output is the same max 5 watts.  I have used mainly on cruise ships and land on port stops and am generally pleased.  Range is dependent on what obstacles are between units, metal partitions in ships are definitely some hindrance, however if you step out on deck, range can be greatly increased.  It is OK inside the non behemoth ships, but I haven't tried in the Oasis Class etc.  Outdoors, range is greatly increased, again depending on line of sight, altitude, obstacles etc. 25-30mi I believe is a pipedream, except  from a mountaintop or across open water.

"There are some rather severe bandwidth issues that occur when converting data from USB to VGA but this little device does the best it can.  Getting really high frame rates and resolution is a nigh impossibility but this converter will get the job done.  I added my third monitor at 1280x1024 and it works fine.  It browses and does office work without a problem.  It also runs YouTube quality videos just fine.  Anything other kind of video results in some frame rate loss.  I tried to open up an HD movie on it and the thing crashed on me.  It supports at least 16bit color up to 1280x1024.  Higher resolutions it will recommend lower color settings.

Be sure you get the new drivers because they promise support up to 1600x1200.  If you want to add and extra monitor but lack the extra VGA or DVI ports this is the way to.  It will work fine unless you are gaming or running HD videos on it.",1.0

I purchased an XL and after first 250 mile ride helmet was so tight I had a 3 hour headache and cannot use this helmet. Found liner was marked XL but inside shell was clearly labeled large. Dealer said all LS2 shells were one size smaller than liner label i.e. Xl helmet was actually a large. This is clearly false product description. Beware and get the next size larger. Better yet purchase another brand. Remove liner and check shell size it's the true size. Dealer would not exchange nor refund purchase price. I will trash it and write off $108 purchase price.,0.0

I came from a Nvidia 8800 GTS that's about 9 years old. It has been in 5 different computers all with completely different hardware and never had a lock ups like this one. I guess that's how 1) AMD gets around the high price point is to not hire anyone that can write drivers 2) AMD vendors use the bottom of the barrel hardware. This started with the classic vertical lines that has been around since the 6000 series cards and just now it just locked up with a black screen.,0.0

"I've reviewed a few kindle cases. This one is really cute and if your looking for something to protect your kindle in your purse (to keep it from getting scratched) this is great. That's because it's cute, and its not bulky and doesn't take up much room.

"Okay here's my review which is honest and unbiased on the ci3 from bluedio. The headphones itself is a very cool looking headphones I do like the fact that the controllers are easily accessible right below the ear and the aircup itself is a plus very comfortable with a silky finish to it. The song quality I give it 4 stars because it still lacks the bass that I'm looking for in a headset.because I listen to reggae and hip hop. The battery is good you do get 5 hours on one fully charged battery which is OK and also has an eq feature which comes in handy to try and tune it to the music of your liking. Overall a good product for running, gym and other sports activities the wind noise reduction is a bonus.",1.0

"I love how protective the Pelican cases are.  We have a number of them in different colors and they are durable and protect cameras from the damp environment on our sailboat.

This is a much larger case than we normally get but it is much more adaptable and can be set up for multiple purposes. We tried it with multiple variations of cameras and lenses.

In the end, we were able to put a 4 x 5 field camera, two light meters, two lenses, and several film holders in this case.  This is all safely packed and easy to move around.  I love how adjustable the Pelican cases are.",1.0
The case design is great. But the lock button was extremely hard to push not shippers fault. And the case material was cracking a touch on the flap around the edges.  Not shipper or sellers fault.

"I had troubles with this item from the start. I didn't get a successful DVD recording out of thing before it decided that it wouldn't eject (not even a paper clip would make it let go!). Luckily, it was a DVD+RW and not one of our bought DVDs. I've only had this item for about 3 weeks and had nothing but trouble.

Its remote is counter-intuitive, going against some of the standard button presses on most DVD/VCR remotes (i.e. after hitting pause, to continue recording, you must hit record, to continue playing you must hit play,  hitting pause again will not work!)

Please do not buy this, save your money, a rubber doorstop will get less in the way and can be picked up for less than $5!

However, adding this antenna has brought in almost every station that broadcasts between Ventura and downtown Los Angeles.

"The 5-star positive reviews here are fake. I've already reported them to Amazon for being fake.  The build quality on this glass is horrific.  The first one was broken as soon as I opened the package.  The second one had the adhesive installed BACKWARDS (on TOP of everything, including the clear plastic film you have to remove).  The home button was installed at a 45-degree angle and does not line up without re-heating the glass and fixing the button.  Once it does finally fit, it just starts popping up again (yes, I fold the digitizer cable correctly).

This glass is horrible. Absolutely horrible. The ""we love you card"" that comes with it only makes it worse, because its quite obvious the supplier doesn't give a s--t about its customers.

Of course the siren on that Piper sets off the loud noise on the other 2. This is seriously a nice system. We have good solid wifi and a fast connection  so all aspects have worked well. My only complaint is no software for the laptop. It would be nice to have a PC application so I could access the system from my laptop.

An initial setup question was responded to with excellent customer support. The cameras may cost a little more than some systems but this is a well designed and integrated system with no monthly fees so in the long run it is far less expensive than the other options I have explored.

This bag is it. It has a small look with space for notebooks, folders, my mouse and power cord as well as my laptop. I have not had any issues with this bag so far and hope that i do not have any problems in the future.

NOTE not for anything bigger than a 15.1 laptop. I have a 15.6 so I ripped the seam on the pocket that holds the laptop so that it fits and it works just fine. :)

I tell you what, this completely rattles my 2015 F250...couldn't be happier. The hefty 600 watt sub channel I think puts put more clean power than advertised and the high pass and band pass crossovers are amazing for powering a set of component speakers.

"This is a great all around lens specially for outdoor shooting. The lens is compact and light so easy to carry. The lens has reasonable focussing speed, the Nikon lenses are faster but it is fine for most scenes except sports. The lens has a limited opening (62mm) and as such requires quite a bit of light which is a challenge at longer focal lengths. However in outdoors it should be OK. I have the Nikon 18-200 DX for my D300 and it is a great lens, but bulky and it creeps. For FX cameras the Sigma 28-300mm brings similar performance in well lit scenes. However the Sigma is lighter and easier to carry. It is a wide-range zoom so imaging is soft at both ends of the spectrum but image quality is generally good, in particular when considering the price.",1.0

For the Note 10.1, I'd recommend just getting a case and using the screen bare, or getting one of those glass protectors.  Using a protector like this on the Note just ruined the experience for me.  I will say that using fingers was fine with it, smooth enough.  The protector is really clear.  But I use the S-pen a lot, and it needs to glide not grab.",0.0

"Lets be honest. Neither PS4 or Xbox One lived up to my expectations. When the original Xbox came out, it was a simple console. Xbox grew over time and amazed us through software updates that constantly reimagined the console. When I opened the box and turned it on for the first time--I was disappointed. The first thing which stood out was the complete lack of backwards compatibility--I have a huge collection of downloaded Xbox 360 content--this is now gone. The console felt boring. There was nothing to do except watch Netflix.

So why the heck did I give this product four stars? The foundation is good. I'm confident the product will grow and evolve just like the original Xbox.

"Bought this on a Woot sale a few weeks ago. So far I've had no issues. Out of the box I flashed the latest build of OpenWRT and got everything configured. I'm *not* running the bleeding edge trunk releases yet, but from what I hear the new 4.0 kernel is supposed to help the Marvell drivers get along with themselves a bit better.

Overall speeds are fantastic. Even on my crappy wifi card in my Yoga 2 Pro I'm able to get a decent speed. On devices with full AC support on the 5ghz band I'm getting speeds that are comparable to ethernet. I run a home theater through this, and I can stream blu-ray rips over the network just fine.

Some are reporting the router will slow down/become unresponsive after a few days of use before needing to be power cycled. I've yet to see this behavior but it is entirely possible it is due to my use of OpenWRT verses the stock Linksys firmware.

If you're somewhat nerdy looking for a slick looking piece of hardware that performs and you're comfortable flashing OpenWRT (easy, btw) to this then go for it. It's a fantastic piece of kit.",1.0
"This leaves more air bubbles than other screen protectors I've used for my 3G iPod Touch, and is not as smooth to the touch. It's also too large, which results in it being easily separated from the screen, and makes it nearly impossible to use a case. Another reviewer here said that he had the opposite problem (protectors too small for the screen), which I find curious. Either there's no consistency with the size of the screen protectors, or he had the wrong iPod Touch generation.

Between the air bubbles and the size issues, I ended up throwing away the first three protectors, even though I cleaned the screen thoroughly and I was as precise and careful as possible when applying the protector. For the fourth one, I trimmed the edges with scissors before removing the backing. While it's an improvement, the size still isn't quite right, and the air bubble issue remains.

"At first, this phone seemed like a terrific value. I read all the reviews, and it seemed like a solid pick. And it was. I work from home and use a headset every day, so this is a must-have for me. After four or five months, I started to occasionally get static on the line, which I could fix by wiggling the plug that goes into the phone jack. After eight months, there was so much static on the line that I couldn't hear anything else. I replaced the headset with another model and the problem is completely gone.

So it looks like this product is only good for several months of use. If you're looking for a longer lasting model, spend a little more money and try something else. (Unless that's how long headsets are supposed to last?)",0.0

"Quite a decent case - It makes it easy to hand carry your ipad from one place to another without fear of dropping it or having it slip from your grip.

"I bought this as an alternative for Apple's $100+ sleeve for my 10.5"" iPad Pro. I use the Smart Keyboard case and use this sleeve when my iPad is not in use. I put it in a backpack when traveling, so I didn't need a sleeve with a ton of padding. This sleeve is nice and thin and light, but I'm pretty confident that it would provide pretty decent protection if I dropped my iPad. The edges have stitching which provides some thickness of material if it were to land on a corner and the iPad's corners don't come all the way out to the sleeve corners, so there's some wiggle room during a drop as well. I would have preferred a sleeve without a flap with a magnet closure on the end, but couldn't find one. I don't like how the flap adds extra thickness and weight. I do like that this flap has a magnet closure that is silent when opening and closing. Overall, its hard to beat this product for the price. I've only had it a few weeks, so I can't speak to the durability of the materials or construction.",1.0

"I have only been using this for a few days so I cannot comment on the reliability (I did change the 8sec. auto park timer to 300sec.) but as for performance, it is faster than the 7200 rpm WD750AALS 750GB black edition and a good bit faster than my 7200rpm Hitachi Deskstar HDT721010SLA 1TB drive, which both are about five years old. My overall through put according to HD Tune pro is 129MB/sec. average; the older 7200rpm black edition was 118MB/sec average. Obviously the random access on the green drive is a little slower than any 7200rpm though but only a benchmark program would only notice the 4ms difference. Overall, if this drive is replacing an older hard drive that is more than a few years old, even a 7200rpm, it will probably perform plenty fast enough.

"When buying a projector, think like this: What are you trying to acheive? 99% of the people who want projectors want to watch movie with it. Now, if you are watching movies currently on a tube TV, then you will be fine with this. But if you want clear and bright picture, then this projector is not for you.
When buying a projector , here are two things you need to look for:
Native Resolution
On a $300 to $1000 projector, the Native resolution is minimum 800 x 600 or 1080p for best.

Lumens
On a $300 to $1000 projector, the Lumens is about 2800 to 3000

Now, consider this projector, this is only 240 ( always look at the last number ) and lumens is about 80. Picture will be very grainy, and picture will be very dim. Your eyes will begin to ache after 30 mins from straining.

"so the charger works as described. functionally i would give this thing a 5 star rating but it gets an overall 2 star from me cause of one issue.
An electrical high frequency noise that this thing puts out when working.
when the units just plugged in, its there , but very mild, but as soon as you put in a battery to charge, holy cow the electrical noise just goes up like crazy. so high that even if you're all the way at the other end of the room you'll still hear it loud an clear. and this particular high frequency noise is just not one of those sounds that you can ignore and it just fades away. this noise will just drive you crazy.

i though it might have been a manufacturing problem, but after exchanging it for another one from amazon, exact same result.
shame , cause the charger really does do a good job at what its supposed to",0.0

"I bought this unit to replace the stock stereo in my '97 Corolla. I wanted an affordable stereo with an aux input that didn't look gaudy or tacky. This fits the bill! It installed easily and without any extra hardware, screwing right into the existing factory bracket. It is simple to use and doesn't look out of place in the dash.
The buttons do feel somewhat cheap, but this is to be expected. The display is definitely too bright at night; it's a pity there's no option to dim it. I will look into covering it with something tinted. The sound is good; while it won't blow you away with either quality or volume, it was a staggering upgrade to the stock unit when paired with Kicker speakers all around.

For homeowners there are better, more user-friendly options.  The Cordpro has no handle and will not completely relinquish the cord without having to fiddle with the inside flap.  It does take a little manual work to reel in the cord - think wrist/elbow technique, only it is going in a container.  Many people will not like this and would rather a handle to help them reel it in.

It does have a reinforced hole for hanging and is not bulky or oversized, so if you can handle the manual reeling, it is a neat little cord reel.",1.0

However a major problem with its design forced me to return it. For me, one of the primary reasons for buying this charger was to free up some of my power outlets, which were all occupied by individual device wall chargers.

Even though this EasyAcc charger only plugs into one outlet, it also covers up the second outlet in a typical 2-outlet board, rendering the 2nd outlet completely unusable.

I loved this mouse. I have no complaints about it except for one.  The cord.  I used this mouse an average of 3 hours a day over 7 months.  At first the outer cloth shell of the cord started to fray in a few spots but it didn't bother me because it worked like a champ. Then one day I went to use it and it stopped working.

The wires literally fell apart and the cord slipped out most of the way from the the inside of the mouse.  This is from 7 months of off and on use a few hours a night.  The cheap mouse that came with my computer holds up better then this mouse did.  It was never dropped and I always babied it since I did spend a lot on it and in the end it just fell apart.

"Although the quality of construction is good, the actual LENGTHS of the cables relative to advertised length are SIGNIFICANTLY short.  I am not a novice, been in tech for over 35 years as a profession.  I know many brands are often a little short, but I decided to try Cable Matters, and ordered 5 multi color pack packages of 3', 5' and 10'.  The advertised 3' cables were less than 2-1/2', the 5' cables were less than 4', and the 10' was barely over 8', nearly 2 feet short.  In addition the same cables in the same pack were not consistent.  In the pack of 10' cables, I had one some close 8', and 8-1/2' and one almost 9', but ALWAYS short, out of 15 total cables purchased, all shorter than advertised, not by a little but significant.

"I bought two of these cameras and packed them away for a trip to Santorini Greece.  I thought it came with batteries and would have bought batteries in the US but I didn't think to check.  After buying and loading the batteries, I tried to feed the film into the automatic film loader and had lots of problems.  After a great deal of exposed film, the door shut and I tried to take a picture.  The button on top wouldn't press down.  I don't know if that was because of the film not being correct or the camera was just a piece of crap.  Needless to say, I had a brand new camera that wouldn't take a single picture.  Luckily, I had bought two, in case one was lost or broken.  The second camera loaded well and took wonderful pictures.  Thank God because I would have been so upset to be on the most beautiful and breath-taking Greek island without a way of capturing it on film.",0.0

"We have kids and the previous camera that we had always had blury pictures due to the shutter lag.  I know this is an issue with all point & shoot cameras, but I can't bring myself to spend the $ on an SLR. When the flash isn't needed this camera feels almost instant with no shutter lag. Plus it has good image stabilization. When the flash is needed the speed is slower and the image quality could be improved. Overall this was a great value for the $.",1.0
"Used it with old memory cards.  Honestly, ran into a bunch of issues reading the cards and not sure whether the cause was this device or the computer interface - ended up ruining 3 out of 7 cards and throwing them away because it asked to reformat blank cards, I said ok then they became unreadable!!  Not sure I would recommend this because can't tell if it was card error, user error or both.  One other thing - I KNOW some cards had numerous old pictures on them but when put in this device, they didn't show up in properties or on the card.",0.0

These headphones are the best 50 bucks spent. The bass is loud as hell and it sounds great. You save 250 bucks over dr. dres beats. Would snoop dogg honestly sign on them if he didn't think they sounded sick? As for the bass booster i wish it didn't need a battery and was maybe attached to the head thing so I don't have to carry it around but hey. really though great product i highly recommend.,1.0

"It's fun, but not something that I can consistently use. I can see how this would be better for folks who don't use a mouse, or need accessibility options or something. Using it with games though just feels more weird to me than helpful, even after a couple hours of adjusting things. Also, setup out of the box was not easy at all, as there was no mention of where to download the proper software. I had to just find it on the web after an hour of looking around. This was a while ago though (I'm reviewing this late), so maybe their site has changed since.",1.0

"Purchased a screen protected last year for my kindle fire. It was easy to apply, the only issue being unable to get all the bubbles out, so I purchased the same maker for my iPad 2 screen protector. Again it was easy to apply, bubbles easier to get rid of. Only issue being the tab to remove after application would not come off unless digging into it with my nail, and then still it was sticky. Very disappointed in this product because I wasted a screen and still had the issues with the second one.",0.0

"It goes down once a day, I would say.  In the search for the problem, and in the down time,  and in the complaints to my ISP thinking they were the problem, this has likely cost me $1000's of dollars, as I am a web entrepreneur.  That is not to mention that this is a replacement for my WRT54G, which seemed defective in the same manner, so I threw it out.  What I have now read is to watch out for cordless phone interference.  Maybe that will solve the problem.

The user interface and advisor is ok, but not great. It misses several items that I wish were there.

So, I wish I had gotten a phone and router that didn't interfere with each other.  Whether this is a problem with routers or just linksys I don't know.  But, in any case, it appears linksys failed to sell me a product that works for myself and a large number of people.",0.0

"Have been using the FM antenna supplied with my tuner which was a 75 ohm FM coaxial cable and the AM antenna was a loop antenna, also supplied with the tuner.  It has been working fine for over 30 years and when I saw thead for theTerk AF9330 AM/Fm Antenna Tower which was also powered, I decided to try it.  I coul not detect any improvement with the FM reception. The AM reception was distorted with a loud hum an was also very noisy.  Putting my old loop antenna on the tuner, the reception was clear without any distortion or hum. Since the Terk AF9330 unit did not improve my AM/FM reception, but rather made the reception worse, I have returned the unit.",0.0
